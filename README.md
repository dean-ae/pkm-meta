## Second Brain

> "Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them." - David Allen

Intelligence has certainly been advantageous in our survival as humans. However, our evolutionary history has only required memory to work well *enough*. Memory need not be perfect. In the period we find ourselves we interact with an overwhelming amount of information – especially as scientists and researchers. Simultaneously, we find ourselves with tools that can compliment our imperfect memory, effectively expanding our brain's capabilities. So, we get to the concept of a digital personal knowledge management system (PKM).

The primary purpose of a PKM is **retrievability**. As you generate ideas and encounter information during the day, you may want to recall some of the details. However, the importance or relevance of a datum may initially be abstract. Thus, your PKM should allow you to freely capture data and annotate them for the purpose of retrieval. This is similar to the concept of the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten).

Here I am sharing my PKM system in Obsidian, a free Markdown-based note taking program. I use the application to manage most of my life, including academic work, general tasks, and creating my personal wiki.

### Why Markdown & Obsidian?

Markdown files (`file.md`) are **lightweight**, **accessible**, and can be easily converted to PDF, Word, and HTML.

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a markdown editor and file organiser that can be as simple or as complicated as you want. But, if Obsidian disappears tomorrow, all your locally saved files will be readable by numerous other programs, such as Visual Studio Code or even Notepad. This cannot be said for purely online programs such as Notion.
