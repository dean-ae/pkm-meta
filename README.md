Here I am sharing my [personal knowledge management (PKM) system](pkm-system.md) in Obsidian. I use the application to management most of my life, include academic work, general tasks, learning languages, and creating my personal wiki.

This guide is intended for anyone interested in PKMs or second brains, but is specifically catered towards researchers.
