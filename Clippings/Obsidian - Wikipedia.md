**Obsidian** ([/ ə b ˈ s ɪ d i.ən,ɒ b -/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English") [*əb- SID -ee-ən ob-*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key")) [^5] is a naturally occurring [volcanic glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_glass "Volcanic glass") formed when [lava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava "Lava") [extruded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrusive_rock "Extrusive rock") from a [volcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano "Volcano") cools rapidly with minimal [crystal growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_growth "Crystal growth"). It is an [igneous rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igneous_rock "Igneous rock").[^6] Produced from [felsic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felsic "Felsic") lava, obsidian is rich in the lighter elements such as [silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon "Silicon"), [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen"), [aluminium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium "Aluminium"), [sodium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium "Sodium"), and [potassium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium "Potassium"). It is commonly found within the margins of [rhyolitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhyolite "Rhyolite") lava flows known as obsidian flows. These flows have a high content of [silica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_dioxide "Silicon dioxide"), giving them a high [viscosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity "Viscosity"). The high viscosity inhibits the [diffusion of atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_diffusion "Atomic diffusion") through the lava, which inhibits the first step ([nucleation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleation "Nucleation")) in the formation of mineral [crystals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystals "Crystals"). Together with rapid cooling, this results in a natural glass forming from the lava.[^7]

Obsidian is hard, [brittle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittleness "Brittleness"), and [amorphous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorphous "Amorphous"); it therefore [fractures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture_\(mineralogy\)#Conchoidal_fracture "Fracture (mineralogy)") with sharp edges. In the past, it was used to manufacture cutting and piercing tools, and it has been used experimentally as surgical [scalpel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalpel "Scalpel") blades.[^8]

Polished snowflake obsidian, formed through the inclusion of cristobalite crystals

The *[Natural History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_History_\(Pliny\) "Natural History (Pliny)")* by the Roman writer [Pliny the Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder "Pliny the Elder") includes a few sentences about a volcanic glass called obsidian (*lapis obsidianus*), discovered in Ethiopia by Obsidius, a Roman explorer.[^9] [^10] [^11] [^12]

Obsidian is formed from quickly cooled [lava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava "Lava").[^13] [^14] [^15] Extrusive formation of obsidian may occur when [felsic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felsic "Felsic") lava cools rapidly at the edges of a felsic lava flow or volcanic dome, or when lava cools during sudden contact with water or air. Intrusive formation of obsidian may occur when felsic lava cools along the edges of a [dike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dike_\(geology\) "Dike (geology)").[^16] [^17]

[Tektites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tektite "Tektite") were once thought by many to be obsidian produced by [lunar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") volcanic eruptions,[^18] though few scientists now adhere to this [hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis "Hypothesis").[^19]

Obsidian is mineral-like, but not a true mineral because, as a glass, it is not [crystalline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal "Crystal"); in addition, its composition is too variable to be classified as a mineral. It is sometimes classified as a [mineraloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineraloid "Mineraloid").[^20] Though obsidian is usually dark in color, similar to [mafic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafic "Mafic") rocks such as [basalt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt "Basalt"), the composition of obsidian is extremely felsic. Obsidian consists mainly of SiO <sub>2</sub> ([silicon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_dioxide "Silicon dioxide")), usually 70% by weight or more; the remainder consists of variable amounts of other oxides, mostly oxides of aluminium, iron, potassium, sodium and calcium.[^21] [^22] Crystalline rocks with a similar composition include [granite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granite "Granite") and [rhyolite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhyolite "Rhyolite"). Because obsidian is [metastable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastability "Metastability") at the Earth's surface (over time the glass [devitrifies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devitrification "Devitrification"), becoming fine-grained mineral crystals), obsidian older than [Miocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene "Miocene") in age is rare. Exceptionally old obsidians include a [Cretaceous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous "Cretaceous") welded tuff and a partially devitrified [Ordovician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordovician "Ordovician") [perlite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlite "Perlite").[^23] This transformation of obsidian is accelerated by the presence of water. Although newly formed obsidian has a low water content, typically less than 1% water by weight,[^24] it becomes progressively [hydrated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_hydration "Mineral hydration") when exposed to [groundwater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundwater "Groundwater"), forming [perlite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlite "Perlite").

Pure obsidian is usually dark in appearance, though the color varies depending on the impurities present. Iron and other [transition elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_element "Transition element") may give the obsidian a dark brown to black color. Most black obsidians contain [nanoinclusions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle "Nanoparticle") of [magnetite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetite "Magnetite"), an [iron oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_oxide "Iron oxide").[^25] Very few samples of obsidian are nearly colorless. In some stones, the [inclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_\(mineral\) "Inclusion (mineral)") of small, white, radially clustered crystals ([spherulites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherulites "Spherulites")) of the mineral [cristobalite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristobalite "Cristobalite") in the black glass produce a blotchy or snowflake pattern (*snowflake obsidian*). Obsidian may contain patterns of gas bubbles remaining from the lava flow, aligned along layers created as the molten rock was flowing before being cooled. These bubbles can produce interesting effects such as a golden sheen (*sheen obsidian*). An [iridescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescence "Iridescence"), [rainbow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow "Rainbow") -like sheen (*fire obsidian*) is caused by inclusions of [magnetite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetite "Magnetite") [nanoparticles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle "Nanoparticle") creating [thin-film interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin-film_interference "Thin-film interference").[^26] Colorful, striped obsidian (*rainbow obsidian*) from Mexico contains oriented [nanorods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanorod "Nanorod") of [hedenbergite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedenbergite "Hedenbergite"), which cause the rainbow striping effects by [thin-film interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin-film_interference "Thin-film interference").[^25]

Obsidian is found near volcanoes in locations which have undergone rhyolitic eruptions. It can be found in Argentina, [Armenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia "Armenia"), [Azerbaijan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan "Azerbaijan"), Australia,[^27] Canada, Chile, [Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_\(country\) "Georgia (country)"), [Ecuador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador "Ecuador"), [El Salvador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador "El Salvador"), Greece, [Guatemala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala "Guatemala"), [Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary "Hungary"), Iceland, [Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_volcanoes_in_Indonesia "List of volcanoes in Indonesia"), Italy, Japan, [Kenya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya "Kenya"), Mexico, New Zealand, [Papua New Guinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea "Papua New Guinea"), Peru, [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanoes_of_Kamchatka "Volcanoes of Kamchatka"), Scotland, the [Canary Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands "Canary Islands"), [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey "Turkey") and the United States. Obsidian flows which are so large that they can be [hiked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiking "Hiking") on are found within the [calderas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldera "Caldera") of [Newberry Volcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newberry_Volcano "Newberry Volcano") (Big Obsidian Flow,[^28] 700 acres) and [Medicine Lake Volcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine_Lake_Volcano "Medicine Lake Volcano") in the [Cascade Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_Range "Cascade Range") of western North America, and at [Inyo Craters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inyo_Craters "Inyo Craters") east of the Sierra Nevada in California. [Yellowstone National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park "Yellowstone National Park") has a mountainside containing obsidian located between [Mammoth Hot Springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth_Hot_Springs "Mammoth Hot Springs") and the [Norris Geyser Basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norris_Geyser_Basin "Norris Geyser Basin"), and deposits can be found in many other western U.S. states including [Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona "Arizona"), [Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado "Colorado"), [New Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico "New Mexico"), [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas "Texas"), [Utah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah "Utah"), and [Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_\(state\) "Washington (state)"),[^29] [Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon "Oregon") [^30] and [Idaho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho "Idaho").

There are only four major deposit areas in the central Mediterranean: [Lipari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipari "Lipari"), [Pantelleria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantelleria "Pantelleria"), [Palmarola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmarola "Palmarola") and [Monte Arci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Arci "Monte Arci") ([Sardinia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinia "Sardinia")).[^31]

Ancient sources in the Aegean were [Milos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milos "Milos") and [Gyali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyali "Gyali").[^32]

[Acıgöl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ac%C4%B1g%C3%B6l "Acıgöl") town and the [Göllü Dağ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6ll%C3%BC_Da%C4%9F "Göllü Dağ") volcano were the most important sources in central [Anatolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia "Anatolia"), one of the more important source areas in the [prehistoric Near East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_Eastern_archaeology "Near Eastern archaeology").[^33] [^34] [^35]

The first known archaeological evidence of usage was in [Kariandusi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kariandusi_prehistoric_site "Kariandusi prehistoric site") (Kenya) and other sites of the [Acheulian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acheulian "Acheulian") age (beginning 1.5 million years BP) dated 700,000 BC, although only very few objects have been found at these sites relative to the Neolithic.[^36] [^37] [^38] [^39] [^40] Manufacture of obsidian bladelets at [Lipari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipari "Lipari") had reached a high level of sophistication by the late Neolithic, and was traded as far as Sicily, the southern Po river valley, and Croatia.[^41] Obsidian bladelets were used in ritual [circumcisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision "Circumcision") and cutting of umbilical cords of newborns.[^42] Anatolian sources of obsidian are known to have been the material used in the Levant and modern-day Iraqi Kurdistan from a time beginning sometime about 12,500 BC.[^43] Obsidian artifacts are common at [Tell Brak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tell_Brak "Tell Brak"), one of the earliest Mesopotamian urban centers, dating to the late fifth millennium BC.[^44] Obsidian was valued in [Stone Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Age "Stone Age") cultures because, like [flint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint "Flint"), it could be fractured to produce sharp blades or arrowheads in a process called [knapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapping "Knapping"). Like all glass and some other naturally occurring rocks, obsidian breaks with a characteristic [conchoidal fracture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conchoidal_fracture "Conchoidal fracture"). It was also polished to create early [mirrors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror "Mirror"). Modern [archaeologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeologists "Archaeologists") have developed a [relative dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_dating "Relative dating") system, [obsidian hydration dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_hydration_dating "Obsidian hydration dating"), to calculate the age of obsidian [artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_\(archaeology\) "Artifact (archaeology)").

### Europe

Obsidian artifacts first appeared in the European continent in Central Europe in the [Middle Paleolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Paleolithic "Middle Paleolithic") and had become common by the [Upper Paleolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Paleolithic "Upper Paleolithic"), although there are exceptions to this. Obsidian played an important role in the [transmission of Neolithic knowledge and experiences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution "Neolithic Revolution"). The material was mainly used for production of [chipped tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chipped_tools&action=edit&redlink=1 "Chipped tools (page does not exist)") which were very sharp due to its nature. Artifacts made of obsidian can be found in many Neolithic cultures across Europe. The source of obsidian for cultures inhabiting the territory of and around Greece was the island of [Milos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milos "Milos"); the [Starčevo–Körös–Criș culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star%C4%8Devo%E2%80%93K%C3%B6r%C3%B6s%E2%80%93Cri%C8%99_culture "Starčevo–Körös–Criș culture") obtained obsidian from sources in Hungary and Slovakia, while the [Cardium](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cardium_\(pottery\)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Cardium (pottery) (page does not exist)") -Impresso cultural complex acquired obsidian from the island outcrops of the central [Mediterranean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean "Mediterranean"). Through trade, these artifacts ended up in lands thousands of kilometers away from the original source; this indicates that they were a highly valued commodity.[^45] [John Dee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee "John Dee") had a mirror, made of obsidian, which was brought from Mexico to Europe between 1527 and 1530 after Hernando Cortés's conquest of the region.[^46]

In the [Ubaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubaid_period "Ubaid period") in the [5th millennium BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5th_millennium_BC "5th millennium BC"), blades were manufactured from obsidian extracted from outcrops located in modern-day [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey "Turkey").[^47] [Ancient Egyptians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt "Ancient Egypt") used obsidian imported from the eastern Mediterranean and southern [Red Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea "Red Sea") regions. Obsidian [scalpels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalpel "Scalpel") older than 2100 BC have been found in a Bronze Age settlement in Turkey.[^48] In the eastern Mediterranean area the material was used to make tools, mirrors and decorative objects.[^49]

The use of obsidian tools was present in Japan near areas of volcanic activity.[^50] [^51] Obsidian was [mined during the Jōmon period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoshikuso_Pass_obsidian_mine_site "Hoshikuso Pass obsidian mine site").

Obsidian has also been found in [Gilat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilat "Gilat"), a site in the western [Negev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negev "Negev") in Israel. Eight obsidian artifacts dating to the [Chalcolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcolithic "Chalcolithic") Age found at this site were traced to obsidian sources in [Anatolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia "Anatolia"). [Neutron activation analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_activation_analysis "Neutron activation analysis") (NAA) on the obsidian found at this site helped to reveal trade routes and exchange networks previously unknown.[^52]

### Americas

Obsidian worked into plates and other wares by Victor Lopez Pelcastre of Nopalillo, Epazoyucan, Hidalgo. On display at the Museo de Arte Popular, Mexico City.

[Lithic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithic_analysis "Lithic analysis") helps to understand pre-Hispanic groups in [Mesoamerica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica "Mesoamerica"). A careful analysis of obsidian in a culture or place can be of considerable use to reconstruct commerce, production, and distribution, and thereby understand economic, social and political aspects of a civilization. This is the case in [Yaxchilán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaxchil%C3%A1n "Yaxchilán"), a Maya city where even warfare implications have been studied linked with obsidian use and its debris.[^53] Another example is the archeological recovery at coastal [Chumash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chumash_people "Chumash people") sites in California, indicating considerable trade with the distant site of [Casa Diablo Hot Springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa_Diablo_Hot_Springs "Casa Diablo Hot Springs") in the [Sierra Nevada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Nevada_\(U.S.\) "Sierra Nevada (U.S.)").[^54]

Obsidian tools found in [Mission Santa Clara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Santa_Clara "Mission Santa Clara") has shown the existence of exchange networks between various tribes in [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California "California"). Obsidian in California comes from 5 major locations all around the state, and when Mission Santa Clara was built, the tribes took their obsidian tools with them and from the analysis of the obsidian tools it showed that all 5 major location of obsidian were present.[^55]

Raw obsidian and obsidian blades from the Mayan site of Takalik Abaj

[Pre-Columbian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian "Pre-Columbian") Mesoamericans' [use of obsidian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_use_in_Mesoamerica "Obsidian use in Mesoamerica") was extensive and sophisticated; including carved and worked obsidian for tools and decorative objects. Mesoamericans also made a type of sword with obsidian blades mounted in a wooden body. Called a *[macuahuitl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macuahuitl "Macuahuitl")*, the weapon could inflict terrible injuries, combining the sharp cutting edge of an obsidian blade with the ragged cut of a serrated weapon. The [polearm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polearm "Polearm") version of this weapon was called *[tepoztopilli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tepoztopilli "Tepoztopilli")*.

[Obsidian mirrors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirrors_in_Mesoamerican_culture "Mirrors in Mesoamerican culture") were used by some Aztec priests to conjure visions and make prophecies. They were connected with [Tezcatlipoca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tezcatlipoca "Tezcatlipoca"), god of obsidian and sorcery, whose name can be translated from the Nahuatl language as 'Smoking Mirror'.[^46]

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Obsidian_from_Milos_in_Crete%2C_3000-2300_BC%2C_AMH%2C_144707.jpg/500px-Obsidian_from_Milos_in_Crete%2C_3000-2300_BC%2C_AMH%2C_144707.jpg)

Obsidian imported from Milos, found in Minoan Crete

Indigenous people traded obsidian throughout the Americas. Each [volcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano "Volcano") and in some cases each volcanic eruption produces a distinguishable type of obsidian allowing archaeologists to use methods such as non-destructive energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence to select minor element compositions from both the artifact and geological sample to trace the origins of a particular artifact.[^56] Similar tracing techniques have also allowed obsidian in Greece to be identified as coming from [Milos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milos "Milos"), [Nisyros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisyros "Nisyros") or [Gyali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyali "Gyali"), islands in the [Aegean Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegean_Sea "Aegean Sea"). Obsidian cores and blades were traded great distances inland from the coast.[^57]

In Chile obsidian tools from [Chaitén Volcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chait%C3%A9n_Volcano "Chaitén Volcano") have been found as far away as in [Chan-Chan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chan-Chan "Chan-Chan") 400 km (250 mi) north of the volcano, and also in sites 400 km south of it.[^58] [^59]

### Oceania

The [Lapita culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapita_culture "Lapita culture"), active across a large area of the Pacific Ocean around 1000 BC, made widespread use of obsidian tools and engaged in long distance obsidian trading. The complexity of the production technique for these tools, and the care taken in their storage, may indicate that beyond their practical use they were associated with prestige or high status.[^60]

Obsidian was also used on [Rapa Nui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island "Easter Island") (Easter Island) for edged tools such as *Mataia* and the pupils of the eyes of their [Moai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moai "Moai") (statues), which were encircled by rings of bird bone.[^61] Obsidian was used to inscribe the [Rongorongo glyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rongorongo "Rongorongo").

## Current use

Obsidian can be used to make extremely sharp knives, and obsidian blades are a type of [glass knife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_knife "Glass knife") made using naturally occurring obsidian instead of manufactured glass. Obsidian is used by some surgeons for [scalpel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalpel "Scalpel") blades, although this is not approved by the [US Food and Drug Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Food_and_Drug_Administration "US Food and Drug Administration") (FDA) for use on humans.[^62] Well-crafted obsidian blades, like any glass knife, can have a cutting edge many times sharper than high-quality steel surgical scalpels: the cutting edge of the blade is only about three nanometers thick.[^63] All metal knives have a jagged, irregular blade when viewed under a strong enough [microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope "Microscope"); however, obsidian blades are still smooth, even when examined under an [electron microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope "Scanning electron microscope").[^64] One study found that obsidian incisions produced fewer [inflammatory cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_cell "Inflammatory cell") and less [granulation tissue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulation_tissue "Granulation tissue") in a group of rats after seven days but the differences disappeared after twenty-one days.[^65] [Don Crabtree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Crabtree "Don Crabtree") has produced surgical obsidian blades and written articles on the subject.[^63] Obsidian scalpels may be purchased for surgical use on [research animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing "Animal testing").[^66]

The major disadvantage of obsidian blades is their brittleness compared to those made of metal,[^67] thus limiting the surgical applications for obsidian blades to a variety of specialized uses where this is not a concern.[^63]

Obsidian is also used for ornamental purposes and as a [gemstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemstone "Gemstone").[^68] It presents a different appearance depending on how it is cut: in one direction it is jet black, while in another it is glistening gray. " [Apache tears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_tears "Apache tears") " are small rounded obsidian nuggets often embedded within a grayish-white perlite [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_\(geology\) "Matrix (geology)").

[Plinths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestal "Pedestal") for [audio turntables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph "Phonograph") have been made of obsidian since the 1970s, such as the grayish-black SH-10B3 plinth by [Technics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technics_\(brand\) "Technics (brand)").
