  {"id":"ackerly2009","abstract":"The concepts of niche conservatism and adaptive radiation have played central roles in the study of evolution and ecological diversification. With respect to phenotypic evolution, the two processes may be seen as opposite ends of a spectrum; however, there is no straightforward method for the comparative analysis of trait evolution that will identify these contrasting scenarios. Analysis of the rate of phenotypic evolution plays an important role in this context and merits increased attention. In this article, independent contrasts are used to estimate rates of evolution for continuous traits under a Brownian motion model of evolution. A unit for the rate of phenotypic diversification is introduced: the felsen, in honor of J. Felsenstein, is defined as an increase of one unit per million years in the variance among sister taxa of ln-transformed trait values. The use of a standardized unit of measurement facilitates comparisons among clades and traits. Rates of diversification of three functional traits (plant height, leaf size, and seed size) were estimated for four to six woody plant clades (\n              Acer\n              ,\n              Aesculus\n              ,\n              Ceanothus\n              , Arbutoideae, Hawaiian lobeliads, and the silversword alliance) for which calibrated phylogenies were available. For height and leaf size, rates were two to ≈300 times greater in the Hawaiian silversword alliance than in the other clades considered. These results highlight the value of direct estimates of rates of trait evolution for comparative analysis of adaptive radiation, niche conservatism, and trait diversification.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Ackerly","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"ackerly2009","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

This paper provides a first assessment of functional diversity along a high climatic gradient for bryophytes, which represent a major plant compartment in these ecosystems. The present study takes place on the highlands of the Piton des Neiges volcano, the highest summit of La Réunion Island (Western Indian Ocean). We find a relatively high species richness of bryophytes in these subalpine habitats, with a peak of diversity at 2750 m for the ground-dwelling community. We report a strong linear relationship between functional diversity and species richness for epiphytes. Within the same plant group, the relationship between functional richness, based on eight traits, and elevation differed between the ground-dwelling and epiphytic communities, suggesting that different processes may structure bryophyte species assemblages along this short subalpine climatic gradient. Higher functional redundancy in ground-dwelling bryophyte assemblages indicates that this community may be more robust than epiphytic bryophytes to disturbances in these subalpine ecosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Ah-Peng","given":"Claudine"},{"family":"Flores","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Wilding","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Bardat","given":"Jacques"},{"family":"Marline","given":"Lovanomanjanahary"},{"family":"Hedderson","given":"Terry A.

  {"id":"albert.etal2021","abstract":"The Mascarenes are sadly famous worldwide for the massive extinction of their native vertebrates since recent human colonization. However, extinction patterns show astonishing disparities between the two main islands and between lineages of forest vertebrates. On Réunion (2,512 km2, 3,070 m) where about a third of native habitats remains, most large-bodied vertebrates, especially frugivores, collapsed by the ﬁrst half of the 18th century, while several have survived longer and some still exist on Mauritius (1,865 km2, 828 m) where more than 95% of native habitats have been transformed. Considering lineages of forest vertebrates shared by both islands (23 genera, 53 species), we test the hypothesis that differing patterns of lowland suitable habitat destruction is the main cause behind this paradox. Before that, we assess the potential impact of other major drivers of extinctions since ﬁrst contact with humans. Firstly, Mauritius shows earlier and more numerous introductions of mammal predators known for their devastating impact (except northern islets which have thus become important sanctuaries for several squamates). Secondly, settlers were inveterate hunters on both islands, but while Réunion was overhunted before Mauritius, the burst of human population in the latter in late 18th century has not led to the rapid extinction of all large native vertebrates. These two factors alone therefore cannot explain the observed paradox. Rather, the early destruction of lowland habitats (<400 m) on Réunion is concomitant with most extinctions of forest vertebrate, notably frugivores that rapidly lost most lowland habitats dominated by large ﬂeshy-fruited plants. Moreover, landforminduced fragmentation has likely decreased the ability of adjacent habitats to act as effective refuges. Conversely, Mauritius retained suitable low-fragmented habitats until the late 19th which probably allowed, at least for a time, several native vertebrates to escape from multiple human-induced disturbances. Despite the almost total destruction of native habitats since then on Mauritius, conservation actions have saved several threatened vertebrate species that play a fundamental role in the functioning of native ecosystems. The fact that there are now more favorable habitats on Réunion than on Mauritius argues for the rewilding of Réunion with these extant large vertebrates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Albert","given":"Sébastien"},{"family":"Flores","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Ah-Peng","given":"Claudine"},{"family":"Strasberg","given":"Dominique"}],"citation-key":"albert.etal2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"amadouissoufou.etal2022","abstract":"The decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) is one of the most important processes influencing the global carbon (C) cycle, the physicochemical characteristics of soils, and the mineralization of nutrients for plant growth and soil food webs. Yet, priming effects are considered to be large enough to influence ecosystem carbon fluxes. Here, we have tested the effects of soil restoration practices on priming effects and carbon fluxes. Our results suggest that indirect effects such as altered stabilization of older C associated with the increased inputs of fresh plant inputs (“priming”) add uncertainty to the prediction of future soil C responses. In addition, restoration influences the abundance and diversity of decomposers, as well as the soil microbial community, by inducing up to more CO2 emission with fresh millet straw addition in fresh state than the predecomposed one. Restoration had strongly increased the impact by up to 22.7%, while the priming effect (PE) mineralization did not increase. The latter of the nonrestored site was lower than that of the restored site by 14.9–22.7%; the lowest mineralization per unit carbon was recorded in the nonrestored site. Through the “4 per 1000” initiative, it has been very recently demonstrated that priming effects could have a noticeable impact on soil carbon sequestration. The study has revealed that the degraded soil played a dominant positive role in the soil organic carbon mineralization. Our results provide solid evidence that SOC content plays a critical role in regulating apparent priming effects, with important implications for the improvement of C cycling models under global change scenarios.","author":[{"family":"Amadou Issoufou","given":"Abdourhimou"},{"family":"Hamadou Younoussa","given":"Bachirou"},{"family":"Soumana","given":"Idrissa"},{"family":"Mahamane","given":"Ali"}],"citation-key":"amadouissoufou.etal2022","container-title":"Applied and environmental soil science","event-place":"New York","ISSN":"1687-7667","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"1-5","publisher":"Hindawi","publisher-place":"New York","title":"Soil restoration practices on priming effect intensity and carbon fluxes","type":"article-journal","volume":"2022"},

  {"id":"aoki.etal2011","abstract":"Cultural variation in a population is affected by the rate of occurrence of cultural innovations, whether such innovations are preferred or eschewed, how they are transmitted between individuals in the population, and the size of the population. An innovation, such as a modification in an attribute of a handaxe, may be lost or may become a property of all handaxes, which we call ‘‘fixation of the innovation.’’ Alternatively, several innovations may attain appreciable frequencies, in which case properties of the frequency distribution—for example, of handaxe measurements—is important. Here we apply the Moran model from the stochastic theory of population genetics to study the evolution of cultural innovations. We obtain the probability that an initially rare innovation becomes fixed, and the expected time this takes. When variation in cultural traits is due to recurrent innovation, copy error, and sampling from generation to generation, we describe properties of this variation, such as the level of heterogeneity expected in the population. For all of these, we determine the effect of the mode of social transmission: conformist, where there is a tendency for each naïve newborn to copy the most popular variant; pro-novelty bias, where the newborn prefers a specific variant if it exists among those it samples; one-to-many transmission, where the variant one individual carries is copied by all newborns while that individual remains alive.

A rapidly changing environment or frequent migration in a spatially heterogeneous environment favors individual learning over unbiased social learning. However, results are not so straightforward in the context of learning schedules or when biases in social learning are introduced. The three major methods of modeling temporal environmental change – coevolutionary, two-timescale, and information decay – are compared and shown to sometimes yield contradictory results. The so-called Rogers’ paradox is inherent in the two-timescale method as originally applied to the evolution of pure strategies, but is often eliminated when the other methods are used. Moreover, Rogers’ paradox is not observed for the mixed learning strategies and learning schedules that we review.

However, in studies on the impact of agricultural management on soil quality, the overall abundance of soil mesofauna and specific groups thereof has not been widely used as an indicator in developing countries. Here, we used soil mesofauna as a soil quality indicator compared to more traditional soil chemical, physical, and microbial indicators, in a comparison of the impact of three diverse agricultural management systems in Central Cuba: state (CSt), conventional private (CPr), and organic private (OPr) farms. We sampled the top 20 cm of soil of 30 fields from 12 farms and 1 natural reference site (NR) and analysed a number of soil chemical, physical, and microbial soil parameters as well as mesofauna (Acari and Collembola, further subdivided into Mesostigmata–Prostigmata–Oribatida–Astigmata and Isotomidae–Entomobryidae, respectively). Differences in soil properties between agricultural fields and natural soil were observed (especially in the multivariate analysis), but no significant differences were observed between agricultural systems, probably due to a lack of differences in soil organic carbon (SOC) content. The mesofauna differed strongly between the NR and the two conventional management practices (CSt and CPr), both in total numbers and in group numbers for most groups and in both rainy and dry seasons, whereas there were almost no significant differences between NR and OPr. Principal component analysis based on mesofauna clearly distinguished NR from all farming systems and OPr from CSt and CPr. Differences in soil mesofauna were mainly attributed to the use of synthetic pesticides. We conclude that in this context, without clear differences in SOC content between agricultural fields, mesofauna is a superior soil quality indicator. Our results indicate that simple counts of total abundance are as useful as counts of specific mesofauna groups irrespective of the sampling period (dry or wet season).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Arboláez","given":"Héctor Pablo Hernández"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Junwei"},{"family":"Orozco","given":"Yaquelyn Nerey"},{"family":"Gebremikael","given":"Mesfin Tsegaye"},{"family":"Alcantara","given":"Edith Aguila"},{"family":"Sleutel","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Höfte","given":"Monica"},{"family":"De Neve","given":"Stefaan"}],"citation-key":"arbolaez.etal2023","container-title":"Applied Soil Ecology","container-title-short":"Applied Soil Ecology","DOI":"10.1016/j.apsoil.2022.104688","ISSN":"0929-1393","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"104688","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Mesofauna as effective indicators of soil quality differences in the agricultural systems of central Cuba","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139322003043","volume":"182"},

Changes in the soil, hydrology. habitat structure, micro-environment, food resources and ecological processes of the afforested area occur. These changes influence native organisms and biotic assemblages in various ways. Generally, species richness and numbers of plants and animals indigenous to the native habitat are reduced in plantations. Species may be eliminated from the planted areas. Woodland and forest species may benefit from pine plantations in terms of food and sites for germination and maturation, nesting, sleeping or resting, and the pines may facilitate the expansion of their local distributions. Few indigenous species are pests of pines, though some can cause considerable damage and economic expense in plantations. Native species are generally beneficial to the forestry industry through their contribution to the maintenance of ecosystem functioning, pest control and additional revenue generation. Correct management of unplanted areas, such as rotational mosaic burning within the natural fire regime, can ensure the continuing presence of many native species in forestry areas. These well-managed areas may be important for the persistence of some species in a region, especially where surrounding land use practices are detrimental to their habitats.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Armstrong","given":"A.

Yet, very little is known about how biodiversity of structurally different habitats is responded to urbanization. We surveyed coprophagous dung beetles and their ecological functional groups—tunnellers, dwellers, and rollers—in shaded natural semi-evergreen forests of sacred groves and the neighbouring relatively open home gardens of sites that represent three levels of urbanization to address the following questions: (1) Do sacred groves have higher abundance, richness, and diversity of dung beetles than home gardens? (2) Is urbanization a key driver of dung beetle abundance, richness, diversity, and community? (3) Is dung beetle assemblage of sacred groves immune to urbanization? and (4) Which ecological functional groups of dung beetles are affected by urbanization? We hypothesized that the sacred groves have a distinct community, resulting in higher abundance, richness, and diversity of dung beetles than home gardens, and the dung beetle assemblage of sacred groves may be immune to urbanization. We sampled the beetles during wet and dry periods using cow dung as a bait. Against our predictions, dung beetle abundance, richness, and diversity were higher in used lands than sacred groves, particularly in urban landscapes. The two habitats had distinct compositions of dung beetles. Tunnellers and rollers were affected by urbanization, but not dwellers. Heliophilic and synanthropic species characterized by smaller species dominated overall catches in the used lands of urban areas.

  {"id":"asiedu.etal2019","abstract":"Climate change affects air temperature, sea levels as well as the soil and its ecosystem. The Guinea Savannah and Semi-deciduous Forest zones of Ghana are characterized by different climatic conditions and vegetative cover. Annual average temperature has been steadily increasing whilst annual total rainfall has been decreasing in both zones, and this has been causing a southward shift of the Savannah into the Forest zone. Soil organisms provide crucial ecosystem services which are required for sustainable agriculture and food production yet crop cultivation disturbs the soil ecosystem. The harsh conditions associated with the Savannah further expose the soil ecosystem to disturbance and loss of biodiversity which threatens food production and security. Soil nematodes are the most abundant animals in the soil and play a central and critical role in the soil food web complex. Studying the nematode community structure gives a reflection of the status of the entire soil ecosystem. Soil samples were taken from cultivated and natural landscapes in the Guinea Savannah and Semi-deciduous Forest agroecological zones to analyse the nematode community. Results from the study showed the Guinea Savannah zone recording warmer soil temperatures, lower organic matter percentage and lower nematode diversity (Genus Richness) as compared to the Semi-deciduous Forest zone. If the Savannah continues to shift southward, the Forest zone soil ecosystem risks disturbance and loss of biodiversity due to the harsh Savannah conditions. Our findings indicate that prevailing crop cultivation practices also disturb soil ecosystem in the two ecological zones which span across West Africa. A disturbed soil ecosystem endangers the future of food production and food security.

  {"id":"atandi.etal2022","abstract":"Despite their important ecological roles for soil health and soil fertility, free-living nematodes (FLN) have received relatively limited research attention. The present study evaluated the community structure and diversity of FLN in a field setting. The experiments were conducted in on-farm and on-station field plots sown to maize (Zea mays) and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) under four cropping practices. These farming systems included organic (compost and biopesticide use), conventional (synthetic fertilizer and pesticide applications), farmer practice (organic and synthetic amendments) and a control (non-amended plots). Nineteen genera of free living nematodes, belonging to bacterivores, fungivores, omnivores and predators were recorded. Among these, bacterivores (Cephalobidae and Rhabditidae) were the most dominant group in the organic systems when compared to the conventional and control systems. Farming systems influenced the abundance and diversity of free living nematodes, with the organic farming system having higher values of maturity, enrichment and structural indices than other farming systems. This would indicate greater stability in soil health and improved soil fertility. This implies that the organic farming systems play a key role in improving the biodiversity and population buildup of FLN, compared with other systems. Our study helps to improve our understanding of how farming systems influence soil biodynamics, while studies on the longer-term effects of organic and conventional farming systems on the build-up or reduction of free living nematodes for improved ecosystem services are needed. •Organic farming positively influences the abundance of free-living nematodes.•Free living nematode diversity is negatively affected by inorganic amendments.•Bacterial feeding nematodes dominate organic farming systems.","author":[{"family":"Atandi","given":"Janet G."},{"family":"Adamtey","given":"Noah"},{"family":"Kiriga","given":"Agnes W."},{"family":"Karanja","given":"Edward N."},{"family":"Musyoka","given":"Martha W."},{"family":"Matheri","given":"Felix M."},{"family":"Tanga","given":"Chrysantus M."},{"family":"Coyne","given":"Danny L."},{"family":"Fiaboe","given":"Komi K.M."},{"family":"Bautze","given":"David"},{"family":"Haukeland","given":"Solveig"}],"citation-key":"atandi.etal2022","container-title":"Agriculture, ecosystems & environment","ISSN":"0167-8809","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"107846-","publisher":"Elsevier B.V","title":"Organic maize and bean farming enhances free-living nematode dynamics in sub-Saharan Africa","type":"article-journal","volume":"327"},

  {"id":"auclerc.etal2009","abstract":"Beside biotic interactions, habitat preference and dispersal ability of species play a prominent role in the building of animal species assemblages. However, these traits are usually very poorly documented for soil organisms. A soil transfer experiment was designed to study habitat preference (including land-use and soil preference) and dispersal ability of soil springtail species living in a meadow and in an adjoining deciduous forest. The study was performed in the Morvan Regional Natural Park (Central France), using untreated or defaunated soil blocks, transferred to another land-use or replaced in their original land-use. Land-use preference was quantified in untreated and untransferred samples from meadow and forest. Dispersal ability was estimated from the time at which species colonized defaunated samples in their own habitat. Soil preference was estimated from the colonization rate of defaunated samples by comparing transferred and untransferred soil blocks. Results showed that in the community, 6% of species were land-use generalists, 30% were soil generalists and 36% recolonized defaunated soil blocks within a week. Land-use preference, soil preference and dispersal ability were largely independent components of species characteristics. Although our experiment dealt only with small-scale colonization, comparisons between species showed that the dispersal type based on anatomical features (legs, antenna, furcula, visual apparatus) does not allow predicting the dispersal ability of these species. Discrepancies between land-use preference and soil preference suggest that other habitat features must be relevant for Collembola, and that a trade-off exists between eco-physiological and biotic interactions (including food requirements).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Auclerc","given":"A."},{"family":"Ponge","given":"J.

  {"id":"auger-methe.etal2021","abstract":"State-space models (SSMs) are an important modeling framework for analyzing ecological time series. These hierarchical models are commonly used to model population dynamics, animal movement, and capture-recapture data, and are now increasingly being used to model other ecological processes. SSMs are popular because they are flexible and they model the natural variation in ecological processes separately from observation error. Their flexibility allows ecologists to model continuous, count, binary, and categorical data with linear or nonlinear processes that evolve in discrete or continuous time. Modeling the two sources of stochasticity separately allows researchers to differentiate between biological variation (e.g., in birth processes) and imprecision in the sampling methodology, and generally provides better estimates of the ecological quantities of interest than if only one source of stochasticity is directly modeled. Since the introduction of SSMs, a broad range of fitting procedures have been proposed. However, the variety and complexity of these procedures can limit the ability of ecologists to formulate and fit their own SSMs. We provide the knowledge for ecologists to create SSMs that are robust to common, and often hidden, estimation problems, and the model selection and validation tools that can help them assess how well their models fit their data. In this paper, we present a review of SSMs that will provide a strong foundation to ecologists interested in learning about SSMs, introduce new tools to veteran SSM users, and highlight promising research directions for statisticians interested in ecological applications. The review is accompanied by an in-depth tutorial that demonstrates how SSMs models can be fitted and validated in R. Together, the review and tutorial present an introduction to SSMs that will help ecologists to formulate, fit, and validate their models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Auger-Méthé","given":"Marie"},{"family":"Newman","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Cole","given":"Diana"},{"family":"Empacher","given":"Fanny"},{"family":"Gryba","given":"Rowenna"},{"family":"King","given":"Aaron A."},{"family":"Leos-Barajas","given":"Vianney"},{"family":"Flemming","given":"Joanna Mills"},{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Anders"},{"family":"Petris","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Len"}],"citation-key":"auger-methe.etal2021","container-title":"Ecological Monographs","container-title-short":"Ecological Monographs","DOI":"10.1002/ecm.1470","ISSN":"0012-9615, 1557-7015","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11]]},"language":"en","page":"e01470","source":"arXiv.org","title":"A guide to state-space modeling of ecological time series","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02001","volume":"91"},

  {"id":"baard.etal2017","abstract":"Objectives: A core objective in South African National Parks (SANParks) is biodiversity conservation and the maintenance of functional ecosystems, which is compromised by alien species invasions. The 2016 Alien and Invasive Species Regulations of the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (NEM:BA) requires landowners to develop management plans for alien and invasive species, as well as report on the status and efficacy of control. Method: To compile the species list, we started with the 2011 SANParks alien species list. Name changes were updated and SANParks ecologists and park managers contacted to verify the species lists and add new records. Species reported by external experts were added in the same manner. The management programme costs and species controlled per park per year were extracted from SANParks’ Working for Water programme database. Results: SANParks has listed 869 alien and extra-limital species, including 752 plants and 117 animals, increasing from 781 alien species in 2011. About R 590 million has been spent by the Working for Water/Biodiversity Social Programmes since 2000/2001. Of the species recorded, 263 are listed by NEM:BA, including 12 Category 1a species, 184 Category 1b species, 28 Category 2 species and 39 Category 3 species. Conclusion: While large clearing programmes have been maintained since at least 1998, improving prioritisation is necessary. We provide a short synopsis of (1) what alien species are present in SANParks, (2) the species and parks that management has focused on, (3) the implications of the NEM:BA Invasive Alien Species Regulations and (4) future developments in monitoring.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Baard","given":"Johan A."},{"family":"Foxcroft","given":"Llewellyn C."},{"family":"Van","given":"Wilgen Nicola J."},{"family":"Cole","given":"Nicolas S."}],"citation-key":"baard.etal2017","container-title":"Bothalia - African Biodiversity & Conservation","DOI":"10.4102/abc.v47i2.2158","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",5,22]]},"page":"1-12","publisher":"South African National Biodiversity Institute","source":"journals.co.za (Atypon)","title":"Biological invasions in South African National Parks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.co.za/doi/abs/10.4102/abc.v47i2.2158","volume":"47"},
  {"id":"bacher.etal2010","abstract":"Some bottlenose dolphins use marine sponges as foraging tools (‘sponging’), which appears to be socially transmitted from mothers mainly to their female offspring. Yet, explanations alternative to social transmission have been proposed. Firstly, the propensity to engage in sponging might be due to differences in diving ability caused by variation of mitochondrial genes coding for proteins of the respiratory chain. Secondly, the cultural technique of sponging may have selected for changes in these same genes (or other autosomal ones) among its possessors. We tested whether sponging can be predicted by mitochondrial coding genes and whether these genes are under selection. In 29 spongers and 54 non-spongers from two study sites, the noncoding haplotype at the HVRI locus was a signiﬁcant predictor of sponging, whereas the coding mitochondrial genes were not. There was no evidence of selection in the investigated genes. Our study shows that mitochondrial gene variation is unlikely to be a viable alternative to cultural transmission as a primary driver of tool use in dolphins.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Bacher","given":"K."},{"family":"Allen","given":"S."},{"family":"Lindholm","given":"A.

Chemical alteration of the litter occurs throughout decomposition, yet our understanding of the nature of chemical change during decomposition is limited, particularly beyond carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). The decomposer food web likely interacts with these chemical changes in their basal resource to alter the trajectories of chemical changes during decay. To investigate how decomposer mesofauna influence patterns of litter chemical change throughout early stages of decay, we tracked mass loss, macro- and micronutrient elements, and fiber chemistry dynamics in Arizona sycamore (Platanus wrightii) leaves decomposed in a mesocosm of optimal decay conditions in a biotically diverse compost pile. By using litterbags of two different mesh sizes to manipulate the mesofauna gaining access to the litter, we identify how the complexity of the soil mesofauna community changes the trajectory of litter chemistry, beyond the typical focus on mass loss and N dynamics. Counter to many examples in the literature, the more abundant and complex arthropod community slowed mass loss and enhanced nutrient immobilization, perhaps due to competition and grazing pressure on the microbial community to immobilize N, P, and Ca sooner from the surrounding compost.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Ball","given":"Becky A."},{"family":"Haberkorn","given":"Matt"},{"family":"Ortiz","given":"Elena"}],"citation-key":"ball.etal2022","container-title":"Pedobiologia","container-title-short":"Pedobiologia","DOI":"10.1016/j.pedobi.2022.150844","ISSN":"0031-4056","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"150844","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Mesofauna community influences litter chemical trajectories during early-stage litter decay","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031405622000567","volume":"95"},

However, in bacteria, the wider variety of mechanisms for gene exchange (or lack thereof) increases the range of expected diversity patterns compared to those of sexual organisms. Two parallel concepts for bacterial speciation have developed, based on ecological divergence or barriers to recombination in turn. Recent evidence from DNA sequence data shows that both processes can generate independently evolving groups that are equivalent to sexual species and that represent separate arenas within which recombination (when it occurs), selection and drift occur. It remains unclear, however, how often different processes act in concert to generate simple units of diversity, or whether a more complex model of diversity is required, specifying hierarchical levels at which different cohesive processes operate. We advocate an integrative approach that evaluates the effects of multiple evolutionary forces on diversity patterns. There is also great potential for laboratory studies of bacterial evolution that test evolutionary mechanisms inferred from population genetic analyses of multi-locus and genome sequence data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Barraclough","given":"Timothy G."},{"family":"Balbi","given":"Kevin J."},{"family":"Ellis","given":"Richard J."}],"citation-key":"barraclough.etal2012","container-title":"Evolutionary Biology","container-title-short":"Evol Biol","DOI":"10.1007/s11692-012-9181-8","ISSN":"0071-3260, 1934-2845","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",6]]},"language":"en","page":"148-157","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Evolving Concepts of Bacterial Species","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11692-012-9181-8","volume":"39"},
  {"id":"barreto.lindo2022","abstract":"Soil systems are highly biodiverse and responsible for important ecosystem processes such as decomposition, nutrient cycling, and carbon storage. Aspects of global change, including CO2 enrichment, climate change, land use alteration, and shifts in aboveground biodiversity all have the potential to affect soil biodiversity, as well as the ecosystem-level processes that they regulate. While there is a growing body of scientific literature recognising and addressing community and ecosystem response to multiple, interacting elements of global change, soil biodiversity and soil systems are still relatively underrepresented in this literature. Yet, at the same time, soils play a major role in global carbon budgets, and therefore hold the key to understanding future climate scenarios. This special issue highlighted the current knowledge of how soil biodiversity responds to pertinent global change factors, and the ecosystem-level consequences of those changes. We received empirical and theoretical studies on land use change, nitrogen deposition, warming, elevated CO2 atmospheric concentration as well as drought and flood. Based on the contributions included, we discuss responses of global change in different soil taxonomic groups, and identify next steps.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Barreto","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Lindo","given":"Zoë"}],"citation-key":"barreto.lindo2022","container-title":"Pedobiologia","container-title-short":"Pedobiologia","DOI":"10.1016/j.pedobi.2022.150792","ISSN":"0031-4056","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"150792","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Response of soil biodiversity to global change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003140562200004X","volume":"90"},
  {"id":"barrios2007","abstract":"The soil environment is likely the most complex biological community. Soil organisms are extremely diverse and contribute to a wide range of ecosystem services that are essential to the sustainable function of natural and managed ecosystems. The soil organism community can have direct and indirect impacts on land productivity. Direct impacts are those where specific organisms affect crop yield immediately. Indirect effects include those provided by soil organisms participating in carbon and nutrient cycles, soil structure modification and food web interactions that generate ecosystem services that ultimately affect productivity. Recognizing the great biological and functional diversity in the soil and the complexity of ecological interactions it becomes necessary to focus in this paper on soil biota that have a strong linkage to functions which underpin ‘soil based’ ecosystem services. Selected organisms from different functional groups (i.e. microsymbionts, decomposers, elemental transformers, soil ecosystem engineers, soil-borne pest and diseases, and microregulators) are used to illustrate the linkages of soil biota and ecosystem services essential to life on earth as well as with those associated with the provision of goods and the regulation of ecosystem processes. These services are not only essential to ecosystem function but also a critical resource for the sustainable management of agricultural ecosystems. Research opportunities and gaps related to methodological, experimental and conceptual approaches that may be helpful to address the challenge of linking soil biodiversity and function to the provision of ecosystem services and land productivity are discussed. These include: 1) integration of spatial variability research in soil ecology and a focus on ‘hot spots’ of biological activity, 2) using a selective functional group approach to study soil biota and function, 3) combining new and existing methodological approaches that link selected soil organisms, the temporal and spatial dynamics of their function, and their contribution to the provision of selected ‘soil based' ecosystem services, 4) using understanding about hierarchical relationships to manage soil biota and function in cropping systems, 5) using local knowledge about plants as indicators of soil quality, remote sensing and GIS technologies, and plant-soil biota interactions to help understand the impacts of soil biota at landscape scale, and 6) developing land quality monitoring systems that inform land users about their land's ecosystem service performance, improve capacities to predict and adapt to environmental changes, and support policy and decision-making.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Barrios","given":"Edmundo"}],"citation-key":"barrios2007","collection-title":"Special Section - Ecosystem Services and Agriculture","container-title":"Ecological Economics","container-title-short":"Ecological Economics","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2007.03.004","ISSN":"0921-8009","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",12,15]]},"language":"en","page":"269-285","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Soil biota, ecosystem services and land productivity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800907001693","volume":"64"},

Here we produce tangible estimates of the total species richness of arthropods in a tropical rainforest. Using a comprehensive range of structured protocols, we sampled the phylogenetic breadth of arthropod taxa from the soil to the forest canopy in the San Lorenzo forest, Panama. We collected 6144 arthropod species from 0.48 hectare and extrapolated total species richness to larger areas on the basis of competing models. The whole 6000-hectare forest reserve most likely sustains 25,000 arthropod species. Notably, just 1 hectare of rainforest yields >60% of the arthropod biodiversity held in the wider landscape. Models based on plant diversity fitted the accumulated species richness of both herbivore and nonherbivore taxa exceptionally well.

  {"id":"basset.etal2020","abstract":"The soil fauna of tropical rainforests is difficult to study because of its extreme species richness and taxonomic impediment. Studies of multi-taxon assemblages in the soil of tropical rainforests are relatively rare and studies of interspecific interactions, such as predation, even rarer. Here we attempt to infer prey predator interactions and enemy-free space from the faunal composition of 100 litter/soil samples obtained from Barro Colorado Island in Panama during the dry and wet seasons. We focused on assemblages of ants (assigned to categories of non-predators, potential and confirmed predators), springtails and termites, which were characterized by their Barcode Index Numbers. Overall in 0.2 m3 of soil/litter we collected 2129 ants, 5592 springtails and 260 termites, which represented 80, 104 and 15 species, respectively. The faunal composition of confirmed ant predators was spatially coincident with that of Collembola. However, despite considerable seasonal shifts in the rank abundance of Collembola species, seasonal shifts of confirmed ant predators were low, resulting in a poor match of seasonal shifts between ants and their prey items. No location could be considered as being relatively free of ant enemies for springtails or termites, but the dry season supported higher prey-predator ratios than the wet season. We inferred only 4 possible prey-predator interactions, out of 7616 potential interactions in the study system. The relative dispersion of confirmed ant predators, which only weakly influenced springtail and termite assemblages, suggests low specificity in ant-prey interactions. This confirms that “brown food webs” may be structured by bottom-up effects rather than by top-down effects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Basset","given":"Yves"},{"family":"Palacios-Vargas","given":"José G."},{"family":"Donoso","given":"David A."},{"family":"Castaño-Meneses","given":"Gabriela"},{"family":"Decaëns","given":"Thibaud"},{"family":"Lamarre","given":"Greg P."},{"family":"De León","given":"Luis F."},{"family":"Rivera","given":"Marleny"},{"family":"García-Gómez","given":"Arturo"},{"family":"Perez","given":"Filonila"},{"family":"Bobadilla","given":"Ricardo"},{"family":"Lopez","given":"Yacksecari"},{"family":"Ramirez","given":"José Alejandro"},{"family":"Cruz","given":"Maira Montejo"},{"family":"Galván","given":"Angela Arango"},{"family":"Mejía-Recamier","given":"Blanca E."},{"family":"Barrios","given":"Héctor"}],"citation-key":"basset.etal2020","container-title":"European Journal of Soil Biology","container-title-short":"European Journal of Soil Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejsobi.2020.103193","ISSN":"1164-5563","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"103193","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Enemy-free space and the distribution of ants, springtails and termites in the soil of one tropical rainforest","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1164556319304479","volume":"99"},
  {"id":"beale.etal2022","abstract":"Ambient temperature is an underappreciated determinant of foraging behaviour in wild endotherms, and the requirement to thermoregulate likely inﬂuences food intake through multiple interacting mechanisms. We investigated relationships between ambient temperature and hepatic detoxiﬁcation capacity in two herbivorous marsupials, the common ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus) and common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) that regularly feed on diets rich in plant toxins. As an indicator of hepatic detoxiﬁcation capacity, we determined the functional clearance rate of an anaesthetic agent, Alfaxalone, after possums were acclimated to 10◦C [below the thermoneutral zone (TNZ)], 18◦C [approximately lower critical temperature (LCT)], and 26◦C [approximately upper critical temperature (UCT)] for either 7 days or less than 24 h. We then measured intake of foods with high or low plant secondary metabolite (PSM) concentrations under the same temperature regimes. After 7 days of acclimation, we found a positive correlation between the functional clearance rate of Alfaxalone and ambient temperature, and a negative relationship between ambient temperature and intake of foods with high or low PSM concentrations for both species. The effect of ambient temperature on intake of diets rich in PSMs was absent or reduced when possums were kept at temperatures for less than 24 h. Our results underscore the effects of ambient temperature in hepatic metabolism particularly with respect intake of diets containing PSMs. Given that the planet is warming, it is vital that effects of ambient temperature on metabolism, nutrition and foraging by mammalian herbivores is taken into account to predict range changes of species and their impact on ecosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Beale","given":"Phillipa K."},{"family":"Connors","given":"Patrice K."},{"family":"Dearing","given":"M.

  {"id":"bedano.etal2011","abstract":"The aim of this work was to assess soil degradation by means of simple and relatively easy to measure biological indicators derived from mesofauna, and to provide criteria to derive threshold values from benchmark sites. We hypothesized (1) that simple biological attributes may be derived from soil mesofauna to be used as soil biological degradation indicators and (2) that this would be best attained by contrasting the deviation of the indicators from natural and managed benchmark sites. The study was conducted on Typic Hapludolls from Córdoba, Argentina. Soil biological degradation was assessed by comparing the deviation of one multivariate and two univariate indicators in intensively managed arable sites from benchmark sites. Three bioindicators were useful to assess soil biological degradation. Specifically, the OM/PA ([Oribatida+Mesostigmata]/[Prostigmata+Astigmata]) index and the multivariate indicator were effective in discriminating between the benchmark and the intensively managed sites and in distinguishing soil degradation levels among intensively managed sites; this finding confirmed our hypothesis. The indicators analyzed were robust and sensitive not only to tillage but also to a combination of management variables. The combined use of Principal Component Analysis and Minimum Spanning Trees techniques also proved to be an effective tool to evaluate the distance between intensively managed sites and between each intensively managed site and the three benchmarks. The bioindicators proposed are simple and easy to measure, and therefore suitable for assessing soil degradation. Validation of the proposed indicators for other soils, climates and land uses is recommended.","author":[{"family":"Bedano","given":"José"},{"family":"Domínguez","given":"Anahí"},{"family":"Arolfo","given":"Romina"}],"citation-key":"bedano.etal2011","container-title":"Soil & Tillage Research - SOIL TILL RES","container-title-short":"Soil & Tillage Research - SOIL TILL RES","DOI":"10.1016/j.still.2011.08.007","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",12,1]]},"title":"Assessment of soil biological degradation using mesofauna","type":"article-journal","volume":"117"},

The most remarkable discoveries include an undescribed Pseudachorutinae Börner, 1906 provisionally assigned to the tropical genus Kenyura Salmon, 1954; Sensillanura austriaca (da Gama, 1963) a Neanurinae Börner, 1901, so far only known from the northern Alps; a second undescribed species of the so far monospecific Neanurinae genus EdoughnuraDeharveng, Hamra-Kroua & Bedos, 2007; the first record of the genus Subisotoma Börner, 1901 in Algeria (Isotomidae Börner, 1913); an undescribed species of the genus Pseudosinella Schäffer, 1897, close to the recently described P. najtae Jordana, Barranco, Amezcua & Baquero, 2017 from Spain and remarkable by the ciliation of all its labral chaetae (Entomobryidae Tömösvary, 1882). This inventory makes the Collo massif the richest spot of Collembolan diversity today in Algeria. It also illustrates how large are the geographical gaps in our knowledge of the Algerian fauna.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Bendjaballah","given":"Mohamed"},{"family":"Zoughailech","given":"Abdelmalek"},{"family":"Brahim-Bounab","given":"Hayette"},{"family":"Hamra-Kroua","given":"Salah"},{"family":"Bedos","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Deharveng","given":"Louis"}],"citation-key":"bendjaballah.etal2018","container-title":"Zoosystema","container-title-short":"zoos","DOI":"10.5252/zoosystema2018v40a16","ISSN":"1280-9551, 1638-9387","issue":"sp1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8]]},"page":"389-414","publisher":"Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle, Paris","source":"bioone.org","title":"Annotated checklist of the springtails (Hexapoda: Collembola) of the Collo massif, northeastern Algeria","title-short":"Annotated checklist of the springtails (Hexapoda","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bioone.org/journals/zoosystema/volume-40/issue-sp1/zoosystema2018v40a16/Annotated-checklist-of-the-springtails-Hexapoda--Collembola-of-the/10.5252/zoosystema2018v40a16.full","volume":"40"},
  {"id":"bengston.dornhaus2013","abstract":"Body size is often positively correlated with ecologically relevant traits such as fecundity, survival, resource requirements, and home range size. Ant colonies, in some respects, behave like organisms, and their colony size is thought to be a significant predictor of many behavioral and ecological traits similar to body size in unitary organisms. In this study, we test the relationship between colony size and field foraging distance in the ant species Temnothorax rugatulus. These ants forage in the leaf litter presumably for small arthropod prey. We found colonies did not differ significantly in their foraging distances, and colony size is not a significant predictor of foraging distance. This suggests that large colonies may not exhaust local resources or that foraging trips are not optimized for minimal distance, and thus that food may not be the limiting resource in this species. This study shows T. rugatulus are behaving in ways that differ from existing models of scaling.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Bengston","given":"S.

  {"id":"bengtsson.etal2012","abstract":"The Western Cape of South Africa is characterized by the hyperdiverse vegetation of the Fynbos biome. Typical fynbos vegetation is a ﬁre-adapted sclerophyllous Mediterranean-type ecosystem on poor, sandy or stony soils. It is characterized by plants with low nutrient content producing slowly decomposing litter. Fire is recognized as a major factor for carbon and nutrient cycling in this vegetation type. However, knowledge of biological decomposition processes in this biome is limited. We used litter-bags to measure mass loss and changes in chemical composition in litter from three species representing characteristic taxa in fynbos, a Protea exima hybrid, Erica multumbellifera, and Restio multiﬂorus, during approximately 180 days. In addition, we used a standard litter of a species with high nutrient content, Galenia africana, and a mixture of Protea and Erica. We compare our results with a previous study from renosterveld including the geophyte Watsonia borbonica, which occurs in both vegetation types and occurs commonly in the study area. We found that decomposition rate among the true fynbos plant species P. exima, E. multumbellifera, R. multiﬂorus and W. borbonica varied almost eight-fold. Litter decomposition was strongly correlated to litter stoichiometry, i.e. C/N and C/P-ratios. Most litters accumulated one or several nutrients during the study period. The mixture of litters decomposed faster than expected from the results of each litter separately. Our study indicates that biological decomposition may be more important for carbon and nutrient cycling in fynbos than previously thought. These results are in accordance with recent studies showing large variation in plant litter quality within vegetation types and biomes. Such large variation in litter quality and decomposition rate suggests that some generalisations about ecosystem processes in the fynbos may need reevaluation.","author":[{"family":"Bengtsson","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Janion","given":"Charlene"},{"family":"Chown","given":"Steven L"},{"family":"Leinaas","given":"Hans Petter"}],"citation-key":"bengtsson.etal2012","container-title":"Soil Biology","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","page":"7","source":"Zotero","title":"Litter decomposition in fynbos vegetation, South Africa","type":"article-journal"},

The treatments included an unfertilized control, ON1 (650 kg nitrogen (N), 400 kg phosphorus (P), 400 kg potassium (K)), and ON2 (1350 kg N, 400 kg P, 400 kg K). In the forest floor, the C/N ratio was lower in ON1 and ON2 than in the unfertilized control, while available P and exchangeable magnesium were higher; NO3 was higher only in ON2. In the upper mineral soil, available P was higher in ON1 and ON2, while NO3 was higher only in ON2. In both the forest floor and upper mineral soil, microbial activity was higher in ON1 than in the unfertilized control or ON2. In the forest floor and mineral soil, Acari density, especially Oribatida and Prostigmata, was higher in ON2 than in ON1 and the unfertilized control. In contrast, Collembola density, especially Hypogastruridae, increased in ON2 relative to that in other treatments. ON2 had less lodgepole pine fine-root length, fewer ectomycorrhizal roots, fewer active fine roots, more nonmycorrhizal fine roots, and a different ectomycorrhizal community structure than ON1 and the unfertilized control.

Yet, neither Latin nomenclature nor animal movement patterns are static over time because modifications result as more data are collected. Scientists have recently reassessed both the taxonomy and geographic range of giraffes, Giraffa camelopardalis. Evidence has been presented that giraffes ought to be classified into anywhere from one to nine species, and that their continent-wide ranging area has compressed by about 6%. A systematic, comprehensive, and critical evaluation of the literature supports the suggestion that the conventional taxonomy of giraffes is due for an overhaul, but serious doubts exist regarding the inference that their geographic range in Africa has altered in the last few years.

  {"id":"betancur-corredor.etal2022","abstract":"Soil fauna drives crucial processes of energy and nutrient cycling in agricultural systems, and influences the quality of crops and pest incidence. Soil tillage is the most influential agricultural manipulation of soil structure, and has a profound influence on soil biology and its provision of ecosystem services. The objective of this study was to quantify through meta-analyses the effects of reducing tillage intensity on density and diversity of soil micro- and mesofaunal communities, and how these effects vary among different pedoclimatic conditions and interact with concurrent management practices. We present the results of a global meta-analysis of available literature data on the effects of different tillage intensities on taxonomic and functional groups of soil micro- and mesofauna. We collected paired observations (conventional vs. reduced forms of tillage/no-tillage) from 133 studies across 33 countries. Our results show that reduced tillage intensity or no-tillage increases the total density of springtails (+35%), mites (+23%), and enchytraeids (+37%) compared to more intense tillage methods. The meta-analyses for different nematode feeding groups, life-forms of springtails, and taxonomic mite groups showed higher densities under reduced forms of tillage compared to conventional tillage on omnivorous nematodes (+53%), epedaphic (+81%) and hemiedaphic (+84%) springtails, oribatid (+43%) and mesostigmatid (+57%) mites. Furthermore, the effects of reduced forms of tillage on soil micro- and mesofauna varied with depth, climate and soil texture, as well as with tillage method, tillage frequency, concurrent fertilisation, and herbicide application. Our findings suggest that reducing tillage intensity can have positive effects on the density of micro- and mesofaunal communities in areas subjected to long-term intensive cultivation practices. Our results will be useful to support decision making on the management of soil faunal communities and will facilitate modelling efforts of soil biology in global agroecosystems. HIGHLIGHTS: Global meta-analysis to estimate the effect of reducing tillage intensity on micro- and mesofauna Reduced tillage or no-tillage has positive effects on springtail, mite and enchytraeid density Effects vary among nematode feeding groups, springtail life forms and mite suborders Effects vary with texture, climate and depth and depend on the tillage method and frequency.","author":[{"family":"Betancur-Corredor","given":"B."},{"family":"Lang","given":"B."},{"family":"Russell","given":"D.J."}],"citation-key":"betancur-corredor.etal2022","container-title":"European Journal of Soil Science","DOI":"10.1111/ejss.13321","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"title":"Reducing tillage intensity benefits the soil micro- and mesofauna in a global meta-analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145075699&doi=10.1111%2fejss.13321&partnerID=40&md5=c714f26b01eccc1b07c6790b957eeb0c","volume":"73"},

  {"id":"birkhofer.etal2016","abstract":"We investigated the impact of regional conditions and land-use intensity on eight selected arthropod taxa of Mesostigmata (Parasitidae), Oribatida (three species), Collembola (one species), Chilopoda (two species), and Diplopoda (one species) sampled in differently managed permanent grasslands of three German study regions. By jointly analyzing changes in abundance and trophic behavior (measured as natural variation in 15N/14N and 13C/12C ratios) we intended to develop a framework for evaluating the impact of local and regional conditions on the ecosystem services delivered by soil animals (mainly decomposition- and predation-related services). The investigated taxa could be assorted to three major groups: (1) numerical response only, (2) numerical and trophic response and (3) trophic response only. Since the combination of taxa assembled in the individual groups does not correspond to any of the conventional soil ecological classiﬁcation systems, this grouping offers a new approach for analyzing soil communities. The complementing consideration of both the direction of the numerical response and the type of the trophic response (change of the basal food source vs. trophic level shift vs. variations in isotopic niches) provided a differential insight into the effect of management and geographic differences on soil arthropods. It could be shown that the effect of land-use on the abundance of detritivorous microarthropods varies among regions, but does not induce any changes in feeding behavior. Our ﬁndings on Parasitidae indicate that carnivorous microarthropods exert substantial predation pressure on soil mesofauna and may be quite resistant to environmental changes due to high trophic ﬂexibility. If conditions are favorable, centipedes may reach comparatively high densities in permanent grasslands and could be very important for controlling belowground pests. Concerning millipedes, isotopic signatures suggest that some species could exert a substantial disservice by feeding on roots over a wide range of land-use intensities and regional conditions. We conclude that the many consistent and signiﬁcant effects found in our study support our contention that the combined analysis of numerical and trophic responses provides a promising framework for designing spatially explicit models that quantify the impact of human interventions on the delivery of ecosystem services by the soil fauna.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Birkhofer","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Dietrich","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"John","given":"Katharina"},{"family":"Schorpp","given":"Quentin"},{"family":"Zaitsev","given":"Andrey S."},{"family":"Wolters","given":"Volkmar"}],"citation-key":"birkhofer.etal2016","container-title":"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"birkhofer.etal2018","abstract":"The assessment of eﬀects of anthropogenic disturbance on biodiversity (BD) and ecosystem services (ES) and their relationships are key priorities of the Intergovernmental Panel for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. Agricultural landscapes and their associated BD provide multiple ES and it is crucial to understand how relationships between ES and BD components change along gradients of landscape complexity. In this study, we related eight ES potentials to the species richness of ﬁve invertebrate, vertebrate and plant taxonomic groups in cereal farming systems. The landscape complexity gradient ranged from areas dominated by annually tilled arable land to areas with high proportions of unfertilized, non-rotational pastures and uncultivated ﬁeld borders. We show that after accounting for landscape complexity relationships between yield and bird richness or biological control became more positive, but relationships between bird richness and biological control became less positive. The relationship between bird and plant richness turned from positive to negative. Multidiversity (overall biodiversity), was positively related to landscape complexity, whereas multifunctionality (overall ES provision), was not signiﬁcantly related to either one of these. Our results suggest that multidiversity can be promoted by increasing landscape complexity; however; we found no support for a simultaneous increase of several individual ES, BD components or multifunctionality. These results challenge the assumption that biodiversity-friendly landscape management will always simultaneously promote multiple ES in agricultural landscapes. Future studies need to verify this pattern by using multi-year data, larger sets of ES and BD components and a study design that is appropriate to address larger spatial scales and relationships in several regions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Birkhofer","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Andersson","given":"Georg K.S."},{"family":"Bengtsson","given":"Janne"},{"family":"Bommarco","given":"Riccardo"},{"family":"Dänhardt","given":"Juliana"},{"family":"Ekbom","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Ekroos","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Hahn","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Hedlund","given":"Katarina"},{"family":"Jönsson","given":"Annelie M."},{"family":"Lindborg","given":"Regina"},{"family":"Olsson","given":"Ola"},{"family":"Rader","given":"Romina"},{"family":"Rusch","given":"Adrien"},{"family":"Stjernman","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Alwyn"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Henrik G."}],"citation-key":"birkhofer.etal2018","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2017.12.027","ISSN":"00063207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2]]},"language":"en","page":"247-253","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Relationships between multiple biodiversity components and ecosystem services along a landscape complexity gradient","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320717314167","volume":"218"},
  {"id":"blomberg.etal2003","abstract":"The primary rationale for the use of phylogenetically based statistical methods is that phylogenetic signal, the tendency for related species to resemble each other, is ubiquitous. Whether this assertion is true for a given trait in a given lineage is an empirical question, but general tools for detecting and quantifying phylogenetic signal are inadequately developed. We present new methods for continuous-valued characters that can be implemented with either phylogenetically independent contrasts or generalized least-squares models. First, a simple randomization procedure allows one to test the null hypothesis of no pattern of similarity among relatives. The test demonstrates correct Type I error rate at a nominal cx = 0.05 and good power (0.8) for simulated datasets with 20 or more species. Second, we derive a descriptive statistic, K, which allows valid comparisons of the amount of phylogenetic signal across traits and trees. Third, we provide two biologically motivated branch-length transformations, one based on the OrnsteinUhlenbeck (OU) model of stabilizing selection, the other based on a new model in which character evolution can accelerate or decelerate (ACDC) in rate (e.g., as may occur during or after an adaptive radiation). Maximum likelihood estimation of the OU (d) and ACDC (g) parameters can serve as tests for phylogenetic signal because an estimate of d or g near zero implies that a phylogeny with little hierarchical structure (a star) offers a good fit to the data. Transformations that improve the fit of a tree to comparative data will increase power to detect phylogenetic signal and may also be preferable for further comparative analyses, such as of correlated character evolution. Application of the methods to data from the literature revealed that, for trees with 20 or more species, 92% of traits exhibited significant phylogenetic signal (randomization test), including behavioral and ecological ones that are thought to be relatively evolutionarily malleable (e.g., highly adaptive) and/or subject to relatively strong environmental (nongenetic) effects or high levels of measurement error. Irrespective of sample size, most traits (but not body size, on average) showed less signal than expected given the topology, branch lengths, and a Brownian motion model of evolution (i.e., K was less than one), which may be attributed to adaptation and/or measurement error in the broad sense (including errors in estimates of phenotypes, branch lengths, and topology). Analysis of variance of log K for all 121 traits (from 35 trees) indicated that behavioral traits exhibit lower signal than body size, morphological, life-history, or physiological traits. In addition, physiological traits (corrected for body size) showed less signal than did body size itself. For trees with 20 or more species, the estimated OU (25% of traits) and/or ACDC (40%) transformation parameter differed significantly from both zero and unity, indicating that a hierarchical tree with less (or occasionally more) structure than the original better fit the data and so could be preferred for comparative analyses.","author":[{"family":"Blomberg","given":"Simon P"},{"family":"Garland","given":"Theodore"},{"family":"Ives","given":"Anthony R"}],"citation-key":"blomberg.etal2003","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Testing for Phylogenetic Signal in Comparative Data: Behavioral Traits Are More Labile","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"blomberg.garland2002","abstract":"Before the Evolutionary Synthesis, ‘phylogenetic inertia’ was associated with theories of orthogenesis, which claimed that organisms possessed an endogenous perfecting principle. The concept in the modern literature dates to Simpson (1944), who used ‘evolutionary inertia’ as a description of pattern in the fossil record. Wilson (1975) used ‘phylogenetic inertia’ to describe population-level or organismal properties that can affect the course of evolution in response to selection. Many current authors now view phylogenetic inertia as an alternative hypothesis to adaptation by natural selection when attempting to explain interspeciﬁc variation, covariation or lack thereof in phenotypic traits. Some phylogenetic comparative methods have been claimed to allow quantiﬁcation and testing of phylogenetic inertia. Although some existing methods do allow valid tests of whether related species tend to resemble each other, which we term ‘phylogenetic signal’, this is simply pattern recognition and does not imply any underlying process. Moreover, comparative data sets generally do not include information that would allow rigorous inferences concerning causal processes underlying such patterns.

For total weeds there were few treatment differences between GMHT and conventional cropping, but large and opposite treatment effects were observed for dicots and monocots. In the GMHT treatment, there were fewer dicots and more monocots than in conventional crops. At harvest, dicot biomass and seed rain in the GMHT treatment were one-third of that in the conventional, while monocot biomass was threefold greater and monocot seed rain almost fivefold greater in the GMHT treatment than in the conventional.

  {"id":"botes.etal2007","abstract":"Recent studies have both shown and predicted that global climate change will have a substantial inﬂuence on biodiversity.This is true especially of a global biodiversity hotspot, the Cape Floristic Region. Although the effects of predicted changes have been widely assessed for plants, little is known about how insect diversity in the region might be affected. In particular, patterns in and the correlates of diversity in the region are poorly understood, and therefore the likely affects of a changing abiotic environment on this signiﬁcant group of organisms are not clear.Therefore, we investigate patterns in, and correlates of, epigaeic beetle (Tenebrionidae and Carabidae) diversity in one of the most climate change-sensitive areas in the Cape Floristic Region, the Cederberg. In particular, we determine whether epigaeic beetle assemblage structure differs between the main vegetation types in the Cederberg (Strandveld, Mountain Fynbos and Succulent Karoo), how restricted these beetles are to speciﬁc vegetation types, and which environmental variables might be associated with site-related differences in beetle richness and abundance. Sampling was undertaken during October 2002 and 2003 across an altitudinal gradient ranging from sea level (Lambert’s Bay) to approximately 2000 m above sea level (Sneeukop, Cederberg) and down again to 500 m above sea level (Wupperthal) using pitfall traps. The environmental correlates of abundance and species density in the epigaeic beetles were similar to those identiﬁed previously for ants across the transect, with both taxa being positively related to several temperature variables. Several species showed habitat speciﬁcity and ﬁdelity, and clear distinctions existed between the vegetation types across the transect. A larger proportion of the variance in tenebrionid species density was explained by environmental variables and spatial factors than for carabids. The most likely explanation for this difference is that the correlates might well reﬂect collinear historical processes, rather than a causal relationship between contemporary environmental variables and species density. If this is the case, it suggests that caution should be exercised when interpreting environmental correlates of species density, and making climate change predictions based on these correlates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Botes","given":"A."},{"family":"Mcgeoch","given":"M.

Because arthropod communities are often governed by both these factors, it can be expected that arthropod communities would fit the biomes. To test this hypothesis, we considered how well arthropod species assemblages fit South Africa’s grassy biomes. Arthropod assemblages were sampled from six localities across the grassland and savanna biomes by means of suction sampling, to determine whether the two biomes have distinctive arthropod assemblages.

These models, at the crossroads between phenomenological and process-based models, are able to involve an intermediate number of well-chosen plant functional groups (PFGs).

We investigated habitat preferences to understand how different cockroach species coexist in sugar-cane fields on Réunion island. Cockroach populations belonging to a guild of seven species were surveyed during one annual cycle in eight sugar-cane fields that differed by several environmental factors, in order to investigate ecological features of cockroach species and their patterns of coexistence. Structure variations of the cockroach communities were analyzed at the field scale, at the sample unit scale, and according to variations of environmental conditions related to the annual sugar-cane growth cycle. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to elucidate relationships between species diversity, population abundance and environmental characteristics. The examination of partitioning at different spatial and temporal scales evidenced that each species occupied a particular type of habitat. The main factors influencing spatial habitat selection were at the sample unit scale: presence of ants, edge effect, soil moisture and granulometry, at the field scale: irrigation, annual rainfall, altitude and age of the field. Although a pair of species shared the same type of habitat, annual population peaks of each species did not coincide in time. This suggests that resource partitioning is based both on ecological factors and interspecific competition. Factors enhancing cockroach coexistence and factors favoring population outbursts are discussed as well as specific invasive capacities of these cockroaches and the role of the cockroach community in the sugar-cane trophic web.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Boyer","given":"Stéphane"},{"family":"Rivault","given":"Colette"}],"citation-key":"boyer.rivault2006","container-title":"Acta Oecologica","container-title-short":"Acta Oecologica","DOI":"10.1016/j.actao.2005.07.002","ISSN":"1146-609X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",1,1]]},"page":"16-26","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Habitat selection and coexistence of invasive cockroach species (Dictyoptera) in sugar-cane fields on Réunion island","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1146609X05000822","volume":"29"},

Initially soil science was focused primarily on agricultural applications, but in recent decades the use of soil information has expanded to include areas like land use planning, environmental applications, human health, and food, water, and energy security. Pedologists now include urban and other anthropogenically disturbed environments in their studies in addition to the traditional natural and agro-ecosystems. With these expansions in the application of soil information it is natural that some have raised the question of whether a new definition of soil is needed. Here we investigate that question by exploring whether the traditional pedologic definition of soil is meaningful in the modern world, with its expanded applications for soil knowledge. The current pedologic definition of soil includes the following key elements: (i) soils are natural bodies, (ii) soils are both spatial and temporal, (iii) soils form at the surface, (iv) soils are the result of complex biogeochemical and physical processes, (v) soils are capable of supporting life, and (vi) soils can be mapped at appropriate scales.

Soil is one of the most diverse habitats on Earth and contains one of the most diverse assemblages of living organisms; however, the opacity of this world has severely limited our understanding of their functional contributions to soil processes and to ecosystem resilience. Traditional taxonomy, based on morphological and anatomical aspects, is becoming replaced by rapid processing molecular techniques (e.g., with marker gene-based approaches). However, this may be impracticable in many ecological studies and consequently, the majority of the current knowledge, still contributes little to our understanding of their role in ecosystem functioning. Over the years, different workers have produced several “functional classifications” based on the body width, feeding regime, certain behavioral and reproductive aspects and ecological niches of soil organisms. Unfortunately, the information available is severely restricted to “major” groups. A better physiological and metabolic understanding of when and how a complex community of soil organisms access nutrients, alter their environment and in turn, affect soil processes, will allow a more realistic quantitative evaluation of their ecological roles in the biogeochemical cycles.

Yet soil organisms remain underrepresented in soil processes and in existing modeling exercises. This is a consequence of assuming that much of the below-ground diversity is just ecologically “redundant” and that soil food webs exhibit a higher degree of omnivory. However, evidence is accumulating on the strong influence of abiotic filters (temperature, moisture, soil pH) and soil habitat characteristics in controlling their spatial and temporal patterns. From this, new emerging concepts such as “hot moments,” “biological accessibility,” and “trophic cascades” have been coined to enable plausible explanations of the observed faunal responses to environmental changes. Here, I argue that many of these findings are indeed “happy accidents” (i.e., “eureka discoveries”) that remain disjointed between disciplines, impeding us from making significant breakthroughs. Therefore, here I provide some new perspectives on soil fauna research and highlight some experimental approaches to better explore the great variety of organisms living in soils and their complex interactions.

In this paper, the effects of improper treatment of cores on the extraction efficiency of predatory mites (Gamasina) from a temperate deciduous forest soil are investigated. Neither prolonged storage, shaking, compression or any of two combination treatments (compression + prolonged storage; shaking + prolonged storage) exerted a significant influence on the total abundance or the body size distributions of the mites. In contrast, both warming over 25°C and overfilling the sample containers of the Tullgren extractor significantly and drastically reduced the recovery of the animals, irrespective of body size. In conclusion, while the total (group) abundance of gamasid mites seems to be rather insensitive against improper sample treatment, the temperature of cores during transport and storage and a suitable volume of material in the extractor containers need to be adressed when planning the logistics of large scale sampling campaigns. Further studies on this topic are encouraged that also include other animal groups, other climate zones, and preferrably work on the level of species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Bruckner","given":"Alexander"}],"citation-key":"bruckner2022","container-title":"SOIL ORGANISMS","DOI":"10.25674/so94iss3id304","ISSN":"2509-9523","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,1]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2022 SOIL ORGANISMS","number":"3","page":"163-169","source":"soil-organisms.org","title":"Effects of soil core handling, transport and storage on numbers and body sizes of edaphic predatory mites (Gamasina)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://soil-organisms.org/index.php/SO/article/view/304","volume":"94"},
  {"id":"brussaard.etal2007","abstract":"Over the last four decades, spanning David Coleman’s career, and in no small measure thanks to him, soil ecologists have made tremendous progress in describing and understanding the overwhelming complexity of biological, biophysical and biochemical interactions in soil. These interactions shape the soil as a habitat for the soil food web and the vegetation and, thereby, regulate the two main life-supporting processes on Planet Earth: production and decomposition. Changes in decomposition and production processes are governed by (human-induced) changes in vegetation composition/cover, the amounts and quality of organic residues and (in)organic fertilizers entering the soil. Such modiﬁcations alter the physical environment and the soil biota. Hence, decomposition and production processes cannot be understood and/or manipulated without explicitly addressing the composition and activity of the soil food web. Using a conceptual model, we argue that quantitative understanding of biophysical interactions, in particular those between soil fauna and soil structure, are paramount to understanding biological and biochemical processes in soil and the availability of water and nutrients to plants. The need to increase the efﬁciency of crop production worldwide, to reverse soil degradation and to increase soil resilience will set the agenda for soil ecologists in the near future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Brussaard","given":"Lijbert"},{"family":"Pulleman","given":"Mirjam M."},{"family":"Ouédraogo","given":"Élisée"},{"family":"Mando","given":"Abdoulaye"},{"family":"Six","given":"Johan"}],"citation-key":"brussaard.etal2007","container-title":"Pedobiologia","container-title-short":"Pedobiologia","DOI":"10.1016/j.pedobi.2006.10.007","ISSN":"00314056","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",1]]},"language":"en","page":"447-462","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Soil fauna and soil function in the fabric of the food web","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0031405606000928","volume":"50"},
  {"id":"brussaard1997","abstract":"We review the current knowledge on biodiversity in soils, its role in ecosystem processes, its importance for human purposes, and its resilience against stress and disturbance. The number of existing species is vastly higher than the number described, even in the macroscopically visible taxa, and biogeographical syntheses are largely lacking. A major effort in taxonomy and the training of a new generation of systematists is imperative. This effort has to be focussed on the groups of soil organisms that, to the best of our knowledge, play key roles in ecosystem functioning. To identify such groups, spheres of influence (SOI) of soil biota-such as the root biota, the shredders of organic matter and the soil bioturbators-are recognized that presumably control ecosystem processes, for example, through interactions with plants. Within those SOI, functional groups of soil organisms are recognized. Research questions of the highest urgency are the assignment of species to functional groups and determining the redundancy of species within functional groups. These priorities follow from the need to address the extent of any loss of functioning in soils, associated with intensive agriculture, forest disturbance, pollution of the environment, and global environmental change. The soil biota considered at present to be most at risk are species-poor functional groups among macrofaunal shredders of organic matter, bioturbators of soil, specialized bacteria like nitrifiers and nitrogen fixers, and fungi forming mycorrhizas. An experimental approach in addressing these research priorities is needed, using long-term and large-scale field experiments and modern methods of geostatistics and geographic information systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Brussaard","given":"Lijbert"}],"citation-key":"brussaard1997","container-title":"Ambio","ISSN":"0044-7447","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997"]]},"page":"563-570","publisher":"[Springer, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning in Soil","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4314670","volume":"26"},

This study evaluated a prey-baiting approach for managing Argentine ants in natural habitat invaded by Argentine ants.

In laboratory assays, L. humile colonies were offered fipronil-treated termites within experimental arenas. The termites were readily consumed, and results demonstrate that a single termite topically treated with 590 ng fipronil is capable of killing at least 500 L. humile workers in 4 days. Field studies were conducted in natural areas invaded by L. humile. Fipronil-treated termites scattered within experimental plots provided rapid control of L. humile and ant densities throughout the treated plots declined by 98 ± 5% within 21 days. Results demonstrate that the prey-baiting approach is highly effective against L. humile and may offer an effective alternative to traditional bait treatments. Furthermore, prey-baiting offers environmental benefits by delivering substantially less toxicant to the environment relative to current control methods which rely on commercial bait formulations and may offer greater target specificity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Buczkowski","given":"G."},{"family":"Mothapo","given":"N.

However, the choice of relevant soil attributes and interpretation of measurements are not straightforward, because of the complexity and site-specificity of soils, legacy effects of previous land use, and trade-offs between ecosystem services. Here we review soil quality and related concepts, in terms of definition, assessment approaches, and indicator selection and interpretation. We identify the most frequently used soil quality indicators under agricultural land use. We find that explicit evaluation of soil quality with respect to specific soil threats, soil functions and ecosystem services has rarely been implemented, and few approaches provide clear interpretation schemes of measured indicator values. This limits their adoption by land managers as well as policy. We also consider novel indicators that address currently neglected though important soil properties and processes, and we list the crucial steps in the development of a soil quality assessment procedure that is scientifically sound and supports management and policy decisions that account for the multi-functionality of soil.

Pachypodium has diversiﬁed mostly into arid and semi-arid habitats of Madagascar, and has been cited as an example of a plant group that links the highly diverse arid-adapted ﬂoras of Africa and Madagascar. However, a lack of knowledge about phylogenetic relationships within the genus has prevented testing of this and other hypotheses about the group.\nMethodology/Principal Findings. We use DNA sequence data from the nuclear ribosomal ITS and chloroplast trnL-F region for all 21 Pachypodium species to reconstruct evolutionary relationships within the genus. We compare phylogenetic results to previous taxonomic classiﬁcations and geography. Results support three infrageneric taxa from the most recent classiﬁcation of Pachypodium, and suggest that a group of African species (P. namaquanum, P. succulentum and P. bispinosum) may deserve taxonomic recognition as an infrageneric taxon. However, our results do not resolve relationships among major African and Malagasy lineages of the genus.\nConclusions/Signiﬁcance. We present the ﬁrst molecular phylogenetic analysis of Pachypodium. Our work has revealed ﬁve distinct lineages, most of which correspond to groups recognized in past taxonomic classiﬁcations.

However, these experiments often conclude that there is a higher probability of including complementary species combinations in assemblages with more species and lack a priori prediction about which species combinations maximize function. Here, I report the results of an experiment manipulating the evolutionary relatedness of constituent plant species across a richness gradient. I show that assemblages with distantly related species contributed most to the higher biomass production in multispecies assemblages, through species complementarity. Species produced more biomass than predicted from their monocultures when they were in plots with distantly related species and produced the amount of biomass predicted from monoculture when sown with close relatives. This finding suggests that in the absence of any other information, combining distantly related species in restored or managed landscapes may serve to maximize biomass production and carbon sequestration, thus merging calls to conserve evolutionary history and maximize ecosystem function.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Cadotte","given":"Marc W."}],"citation-key":"cadotte2013","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"cahill.etal2008","abstract":"A widely assumed but largely untested hypothesis central to ecology and evolutionary biology has been Charles Darwin’s suggestion that closely related species will be more ecologically similar, and thus will compete more strongly with each other than they will with more distantly related species. We provide one of the ﬁrst direct tests of the ‘‘competition-relatedness hypothesis’’ by combining two data sets: the relative competitive ability of 50 vascular plant species competing against 92 competitor species measured in ﬁve multi-species experiments, and measures of the phylogenetic relatedness of these species. In contrast to Darwin’s assertion, there were weak relationships between the strength of competition and phylogenetic relatedness. Across all species studied, the competition-relatedness relationship was weak and not signiﬁcant. This overall lack of pattern masked different responses of monocot and eudicot focal (phytometer) species. When monocots served as the focal (phytometer) species, the intensity of competition increased with the phylogenetic distance separating species, while competition decreased with phylogenetic distance for eudicot phytometers. These results were driven by the monocot-eudicot evolutionary split, such that monocots were poor competitors against eudicots, while eudicots are most strongly suppressed by other eudicots. There was no relationship between relatedness and competition for eudicots competing with other eudicots, while monocots did compete more intensely with closely related monocots than with distantly related monocots. Overall, the relationships between competition intensity and relatedness were weak compared to the strong and consistent relationships between competitive ability and functional traits such as plant size that have been reported by other studies. We suggest that Darwin’s assertion that competition will be strongest among closely related species is not supported by empirical data, at least for the 142 vascular plant species in this study.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Cahill","given":"James F."},{"family":"Kembel","given":"Steven W."},{"family":"Lamb","given":"Eric G."},{"family":"Keddy","given":"Paul A."}],"citation-key":"cahill.etal2008","container-title":"Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics","container-title-short":"Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics","DOI":"10.1016/j.ppees.2007.10.001","ISSN":"14338319","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",3]]},"language":"en","page":"41-50","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Does phylogenetic relatedness influence the strength of competition among vascular plants?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1433831907000479","volume":"10"},

Indicator species complement the information obtained from the measurement of environment quality by using physicochemical variables.

We studied the effects of seven diesel concentrations on survival and other population parameters of Orthonychiurus folsomi under laboratory conditions; we evaluated the springtails response on survival, fecundity, population size, hatching and development time. Survival and fertility were analyzed by using generalized linear models (GLM). An ANOVA test was used to analyze the final population size and a Kruskal–Wallis test for oviposition, hatching, and development times. Results showed that diesel has negative effects on some population parameters. The most evident effects were recorded above 500 mg/kg concentrations. A significant decrease in survival, fertility, and population size was recorded in function of diesel concentration increase. The estimated LC50 for survival was 955 mg/kg. Oviposition and hatching time increased significantly when diesel concentrations were above 500 mg/kg, while development time increased slightly at low diesel concentrations but decreased at concentrations above 500 mg/kg. Population final size decreased as soil diesel concentrations increased.

  {"id":"cardenas.etal2017","abstract":"Global biodiversity loss is creating a more urgent need to understand the role organisms play in ecosystem functioning and mechanisms of control. Decomposition of dead organic matter is a key ecological process that ensures soil formation, nutrient availability, and carbon sequestration. To gain understanding of how biodiversity and ecosystems function together to control leaf-litter decomposition processes in a tropical rain forest (Yasuní National Park, Ecuador), we predicted the consequences of the decomposition process using a protocol in which we systematically disassemble the structural functionality of the soil macrofauna communities. We (1) describe the structure and function of the edaphic communities in detail and (2) explore the functional consequences of structural changes in these communities using a non-random exclusion experiment to simulate body size-related extinctions. To do this, we manipulated access of five size classes of soil invertebrates to eight types of plant leaf-litter resources. After measuring and identifying about 4400 soil individuals belonging to 541 morphospecies, 12 functional groups, and following the fate of about 2000 tree leaves in a 50-ha plot, we showed that (1) soil invertebrate communities were composed of a few common and many rare morphospecies that included mostly leaf-litter transformer groups, with the most morphospecies and the greatest abundance coming from Hymenoptera, Collembola, and Coleoptera; (2) our survey captured 63–74% of the total soil biodiversity of the study area (meaning there may be up to 860 morphospecies); (3) litter transformers covered the widest range of body volume, and all groups were evenly distributed at small and large spatial scales (i.e., we found no patterns of spatial aggregation); (4) changes in food web structure significantly altered biomass loss for only three of the eight leaf-litter treatments, suggesting the decomposition process was highly resistant to drastic changes such as size-biased biodiversity loss independent of resource quality. We conclude organic matter decomposition may depend on all non-additive effects that arise from multi-species interactions, including facilitation, interspecific interference competition, and top-down control that predators exert over detritivores at all body size ranges.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Cárdenas","given":"Rafael E."},{"family":"Donoso","given":"David A."},{"family":"Argoti","given":"Adriana"},{"family":"Dangles","given":"Olivier"}],"citation-key":"cardenas.etal2017","container-title":"Ecosphere","DOI":"10.1002/ecs2.1692","ISSN":"2150-8925","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","page":"e01692","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Functional consequences of realistic extinction scenarios in Amazonian soil food webs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecs2.1692","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"cassagnau1996","abstract":"Below are described 36 species of Neanurinae Collembola mainly harvested in Eastern Africa and in Madagascar. They belong to the following three genera : Paleonura, Pronura, and Afrobella, all three mainly paleo-tropical. We also redescribe the type of the Pronura genus, P. kilimandjarica Delamare, 1948. All these species are therefore Paleonurini, the only tribe to have peopled Africa South of the Sahara. They are systematically very close to the species described from Asia. These are : Paleonura aberdarensis, africana, dejeani, anosyennica, coalescens, plumosa; Pronura aciculifer, alata, bouakensis, camerounensis, celisi, curviseta, fluctuans, kilimandjarica Delamare, kyandolirensis, major, nana, regularis, ruwenzorensis, trisetosa, anjavicola, caeca, elegans, laminata, lemurica, madagascariensis, prima, pumilio setimigrans, sphaeroculata, straturata; Afrobella delamarei, kirivatensis, thibaudi, wittei, mamillata, scoparia. The Afrobella are the harbingers of the species of the Bilobella genus that singled itself in the Mediterranean area and can be found as far North as Austria. The Paleonurini seem to have scattered from East to West, from the Far East to the Atlantic. Their peopling can thus be put together with the migrations from East to West performed by the lineages studied by Jeannel, whose expansion probally took place toward Africa and Europe during the Montien period (in Carabidae or Pselaphidae Coleoptera).","archive":"Scopus","author":[{"family":"Cassagnau","given":"P."}],"citation-key":"cassagnau1996","container-title":"Annales de la Societe Entomologique de France","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996"]]},"page":"121-161","title":"Primitive Paleonurini Collembola from Africa and Madagascar","title-short":"Collemboles Paleonurini primitifs d'Afrique et de Madagascar","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0030547120&partnerID=40&md5=8fac5861b19aee106645c4d72c2fc29c","volume":"32"},

  {"id":"castellanosmelendez.etal2023","abstract":"Explosive eruptions of trachytic to trachyandesitic composition produced thick and widespread pyroclastic deposits during the recent volcanic activity of Piton des Neiges (PdN), the largest volcano of La Réunion Island (France). However, without precise geochronology for these eruptions, the future behavior of the dormant volcano is difficult to assess. New high-resolution single crystal 40Ar/39Ar dates on alkali feldspar, together with petrochemical data on juvenile clasts, indicate that instead of multiple and small eruptions, PdN produced a single large-volume event (“Dalle Soudée” eruption) at 198.8 ± 2.5 kyrs in which its entire crustal plumbing system was reactivated by mafic injections in the silicic reservoir. After 60 kyrs of quiescence, PdN activity resumed with several small silicic eruptions. From a dome-forming trachytic event (Belouve eruption) represented by some of the most recent block-and-ash flow deposits near the present-day summit we report in-situ 238U/230Th disequilibrium dates on pristine zircons. Sanidine and zircon crystalized at ca. 875 °C in the trachytic magma. For this event, the corresponding 238U/230Th isochron age of the zircons overlaps with the youngest 40Ar/39Ar dates on single sanidine crystals and yields an age of 42.7 ± 3.8 kyr. The variability in trace elements of zircon argues for a prolonged crystallization during this phase prior to eruption. Similarly, the 40Ar/39Ar sanidine dates show a significant spread in both eruptions, covering ca. 80 kyrs, uncommon for a method with a predicted low closure temperature. Such a pattern of age distribution argues for the presence of inherited argon in sanidines and for long residence times in the magma reservoir. The recent eruptive history of Piton des Neiges, involving evolved magma compositions, long-living silicic reservoirs and millennia-long quiescence in volcanic activity, suggests that future potentially hazardous eruptions from this volcano cannot be excluded.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Castellanos Melendez","given":"Maria Paula"},{"family":"Di Muro","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Laurent","given":"Oscar"},{"family":"Kuiper","given":"Klaudia"},{"family":"Wijbrans","given":"Jan R."},{"family":"Bachmann","given":"Olivier"}],"citation-key":"castellanosmelendez.etal2023","container-title":"Chemical Geology","container-title-short":"Chemical Geology","DOI":"10.1016/j.chemgeo.2023.121539","ISSN":"0009-2541","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,20]]},"page":"121539","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Explosive volcanism of Piton des Neiges (Reunion Island) and excess age dispersion in sanidine: Insights into magma chamber processes in a hotspot setting","title-short":"Explosive volcanism of Piton des Neiges (Reunion Island) and excess age dispersion in sanidine","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009254123002395","volume":"632"},

Cumulative culture requires key psychological processes (fundamentally imitation and teaching) that are absent or impoverished in non-human primates. In this paper we analyze the role that teaching has played in human cumulative cultural evolution. We assume that a system of cumulative culture generates increasingly adaptive behaviors, that are also more complex and difﬁcult to imitate. Our thesis is that, as cultural traits become more complex, cumulative cultural transmission requires teaching to ensure accurate transmission from one generation to the next. In an increasingly complex cultural environment, we consider that individuals commit errors in imitation. We develop a model of cumulative cultural evolution in a changing environment and show that these errors hamper the process of cultural accumulation. We also show that a system of teaching between parents and offspring that increases the ﬁdelity of imitation unblocks the accumulation and becomes adaptive whenever the gain in ﬁtness compensates the cost of teaching.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Castro","given":"Laureano"},{"family":"Toro","given":"Miguel A."}],"citation-key":"castro.toro2014","container-title":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","container-title-short":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jtbi.2014.01.006","ISSN":"00225193","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4]]},"language":"en","page":"74-83","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Cumulative cultural evolution: The role of teaching","title-short":"Cumulative cultural evolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022519314000150","volume":"347"},

In particular, the detritivores are regarded as food generalists. We have investigated nitrogen stable isotope ratios (15N/14N) of a major decomposer group, the Collembola, to evaluate trophic relationship and determine feeding guilds. Additionally, the δ15N values of potential food sources such as mosses, lichens and other plant derived material (bark, nuts, leaves) were analysed. The natural variation in nitrogen isotopes was assessed in 20 Collembola taxa from three deciduous forest stands. The δ15N signature formed a continuum from phycophages/herbivores to primary and secondary decomposers, reflecting a gradual shift from more detrital to more microbial diets. The δ15N gradient spanned over 9 δ units, which implies a wide range in food sources used. Assuming a shift in 15N of about 3 ‰ per trophic level, the results indicate a range of three trophic levels. These variations in 15N/14N ratios suggest that trophic niches of Collembola species differ and this likely contributes to Collembola species diversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Chahartaghi","given":"Masoumeh"},{"family":"Langel","given":"Reinhard"},{"family":"Scheu","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Ruess","given":"Liliane"}],"citation-key":"chahartaghi.etal2005","container-title":"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","container-title-short":"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","DOI":"10.1016/j.soilbio.2005.02.006","ISSN":"0038-0717","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1718-1725","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Feeding guilds in Collembola based on nitrogen stable isotope ratios","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071705000714","volume":"37"},

  {"id":"chao.etal2009","abstract":"Biodiversity sampling is labor intensive, and a substantial fraction of a biota is often represented by species of very low abundance, which typically remain undetected by biodiversity surveys. Statistical methods are widely used to estimate the asymptotic number of species present, including species not yet detected. Additional sampling is required to detect and identify these species, but richness estimators do not indicate how much sampling effort (additional individuals or samples) would be necessary to reach the asymptote of the species accumulation curve. Here we develop the first statistically rigorous nonparametric method for estimating the minimum number of additional individuals, samples, or sampling area required to detect any arbitrary proportion (including 100%) of the estimated asymptotic species richness. The method uses the Chaol and Chao2 nonparametric estimators of asymptotic richness, which are based on the frequencies of rare species in the original sampling data. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we randomly subsampled individuals or quadrats from two large biodiversity inventories (light trap captures of Lepidoptera in Great Britain and censuses of woody plants on Barro Colorado Island [BCI], Panama). The simulation results suggest that the method performs well but is slightly conservative for small sample sizes. Analyses of the BCI results suggest that the method is robust to nonindependence arising from small-scale spatial aggregation of species occurrences. When the method was applied to seven published biodiversity data sets, the additional sampling effort necessary to capture all the estimated species ranged from 1.05 to 10.67 times the original sample (median *** 2.23). Substantially less effort is needed to detect 90% of the species (0.33-1.10 times the original effort; median ?* 0.80). An Excel spreadsheet tool is provided for calculating necessary sampling effort for either abundance data or replicated incidence data.

  {"id":"chesson2000","abstract":"▪ Abstract  The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coexistence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Chesson","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"chesson2000","container-title":"Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics","container-title-short":"Annu.

However, few studies have examined the effects of TBI on the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. To investigate this aspect, and to compare TBI with a more typical forest plantation (FO) system, a field experiment using soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr. cv. SO3-W4) and poplar (Populus nigra L.×P. maximowiczii cv. A. Henry ‘Max 5’) was conducted on an arable field site in southwestern Québec. The species of AM fungi colonizing the roots were assessed by PCR-RFLP and DNA sequence analyses of SSU rRNA genes. A total of 13 different phylotypes were identified. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that these belonged to the genera Glomus (11), Acaulospora (1) and Scutellospora (1). The AM fungal diversity, as expressed by the Shannon–Wiener indices, were 0.82±0.08 for the soybean and 0.70±0.11 for poplar under the TBI system, and 0.53±0.08 for poplar under the FO system. The study also investigated the distribution of AM fungal spores in the soil, and this differed in the two systems. Under the TBI system, spore abundance increased with increasing distance from the poplar trunk, while it remained relatively constant under the FO system. Our results also show that neighbouring trees and soybean plants hosted different AM fungal communities, suggesting that TBI systems may enhance AM fungal richness compared to monocultures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Chifflot","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Rivest","given":"David"},{"family":"Olivier","given":"Alain"},{"family":"Cogliastro","given":"Alain"},{"family":"Khasa","given":"Damase"}],"citation-key":"chifflot.etal2009","collection-title":"Temperate agroforestry: When trees and crops get together","container-title":"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","container-title-short":"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.agee.2008.11.010","ISSN":"0167-8809","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"32-39","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Molecular analysis of arbuscular mycorrhizal community structure and spores distribution in tree-based intercropping and forest systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880908002995","volume":"131"},

However, the evolutionary signiﬁcance of this genetic diversity is unknown. In this study, we sample ﬁve morphological species of the globally distributed genus Lepidocyrtus from 14 Panamanian sampling sites to characterize genetic diversity and test morphospecies against the biological species concept. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data were analysed and a total of 58 molecular lineages revealed. Deep lineage diversiﬁcation was recovered, with 30 molecular lineages estimated to have established more than 10 million years ago, and the origin almost all contemporary lineages preceding the onset of the Pleistocene (~2 Mya). Thirty-four lineages were sampled in sympatry revealing unambiguous cosegregation of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence variation, consistent with biological species. Species richness within the class Collembola and the geographical structure of this diversity are substantially misrepresented components of terrestrial animal biodiversity.

Comparison of Collembola mitochondrial metagenomic data to a database of more than 80 000 Collembola barcode sequences revealed almost 30% of sampled island species are genetically identical, or near identical, to individuals sampled from often very distant geographic regions of the world. Patterns of mtDNA relatedness among Collembola implicate humanmediated species introductions, with minimum estimates for the proportion of introduced species on the sampled islands ranging from 45% to 88%. Our results call for more attention to soil mesofauna to understand the global extent and ecological consequences of species introductions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Cicconardi","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Borges","given":"Paulo A.

The Brazilian species of eyeless Pseudosinella herein described present a remarkably conservate dorsal chaetotaxy; therefore, the main diagnostic characters are related to other features like prelabral, labral, and ventral head chaetotaxy and empodial complex morphology.

  {"id":"colville.etal2002","abstract":"Species turnover of monkey beetle (Scarabaeidae: Hopliini) assemblages along disturbance and environmental gradients was examined at three sites within the arid, winter rainfall Namaqualand region of the succulent Karoo, South Africa. At each site two study plots with comparable vegetation and soils but contrasting management (grazing) histories were chosen, the disturbed sites having fewer perennial shrubs and generally more annuals and bare ground. Beetles collected using coloured pan-traps showed a consistently higher abundance in disturbed sites. Lepithrix, Denticnema and Heterochelus had higher numbers in disturbed plots, while Peritrichia numbers were lower in disturbed areas. Measures of species richness and diversity were consistently higher in the undisturbed sites. Distinctive assemblages of monkey beetles and plants occurred at each site. A high compositional turnover (β diversity) was recorded for both monkey beetles and plants along a rainfall gradient; between-site β diversity values ranged from 0.7 to 0.8 (out of a maximum of 1.0). Species turnover of beetles was higher between the disturbed sites along the environmental gradient than the corresponding undisturbed sites. The high monkey beetle species turnover is probably linked to the high plant species turnover, a distinctive feature of succulent Karoo landscapes. Monkey beetles are useful indicators of overgrazing disturbance in Namaqualand, as their pollinator guilds are apparently disrupted by overgrazing. A shift away from perennial and bulb pollinator guilds towards those favouring weedy annuals was observed in disturbed areas. The consequences to ecosystem processes due to the effects of disturbance on monkey beetle communities and the role of monkey beetles as indicators of disturbance is discussed, as well as the implications of disturbance on monkey beetle pollination guilds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Colville","given":"J."},{"family":"Picker","given":"M.D."},{"family":"Cowling","given":"R.M."}],"citation-key":"colville.etal2002","container-title":"Biodiversity & Conservation","container-title-short":"Biodiversity and Conservation","DOI":"10.1023/A:1014520226989","ISSN":"1572-9710","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"243-264","source":"Springer Link","title":"Species turnover of monkey beetles (Scarabaeidae: Hopliini) along environmental and disturbance gradients in the Namaqualand region of the succulent Karoo, South Africa","title-short":"Species turnover of monkey beetles (Scarabaeidae","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1014520226989","volume":"11"},

In this review we summarize the current state of knowledge of soil fauna as it relates to and is inﬂuenced by various disturbances.

Many of the first quantitative models of cultural evolution were modified from existing concepts in theoretical population genetics because cultural evolution has many parallels with, as well as clear differences from, genetic evolution. Furthermore, cultural and genetic evolution can interact with one another and influence both transmission and selection. This interaction requires theoretical treatments of gene–culture coevolution and dual inheritance, in addition to purely cultural evolution. In addition, cultural evolutionary theory is a natural component of studies in demography, human ecology, and many other disciplines. Here, we review the core concepts in cultural evolutionary theory as they pertain to the extension of biology through culture, focusing on cultural evolutionary applications in population genetics, ecology, and demography. For each of these disciplines, we review the theoretical literature and highlight relevant empirical studies. We also discuss the societal implications of the study of cultural evolution and of the interactions of humans with one another and with their environment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Creanza","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Kolodny","given":"Oren"},{"family":"Feldman","given":"Marcus W."}],"citation-key":"creanza.etal2017","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

Different forage species have variable concentrations of essential nutrients and rooting patterns, potentially affecting soil biology and soileplanteanimal interactions. Our study compared the effect of growing different forage crops on soil faunal diversity and abundance. Plots of chicory (Cichorium intybus), red clover (Trifolium pratense), white clover (Trifolium repens) or perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) were established in 2009 and maintained over a four year period. Soil faunal samples were taken, including soil mesofauna, nematodes and earthworms, at the end of this period in autumn 2012 and spring 2013. Signiﬁcant differences were found between the forages for a number of biological groups, as well as some seasonal differences; overall earthworm abundance and biomass was higher within the white clover treatment, speciﬁcally anecic earthworms. Nematode functional groups were found to differ, with greater numbers of fungal feeders in the clovers and chicory treatments, whilst the herbivores had the greatest abundances in the two ryegrass treatments. Overall the microarthropod order abundances did not differ, however two collembolan superfamilies did show differences between treatments with the detritivorous Poduromorpha having a higher abundance in the clovers and chicory treatment and the herbivorous Symphypleona had a higher abundance in the ryegrass treatment. Relatively little is known about the links between soil biology and the effects of plant type because of the complex nature of soil, however here we have begun to reveal some of these linkages. Overall, the ﬁndings indicate a relationship between ryegrass and herbivorous invertebrates, whilst the other forages have a stronger relationship with decomposer invertebrates; changing the dominance within the soil food web dependent on forage type.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Crotty","given":"F.V."},{"family":"Fychan","given":"R."},{"family":"Scullion","given":"J."},{"family":"Sanderson","given":"R."},{"family":"Marley","given":"C.L."}],"citation-key":"crotty.etal2015","container-title":"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","container-title-short":"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","DOI":"10.1016/j.soilbio.2015.08.036","ISSN":"00380717","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",12]]},"language":"en","page":"119-126","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Assessing the impact of agricultural forage crops on soil biodiversity and abundance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0038071715003144","volume":"91"},

To address such gaps in information this research was conducted with objectives to determine what Collembola species inhabit agricultural soils of Esp´ırito Santo, Brazil; obtain a record of the seasonal abundance of Collembola in this area; and to investigate effects of alternative agricultural practices on Collembola in this tropical environment. Research ﬁeld sites are located in Domingos Martins municipality, Esp´ırito Santo (20◦23 S, 41◦03 W) and consist of three sites: (A) fertilizer site, with two fertilizer treatments, organic fertilizer and inorganic fertilizer; (B) tillage site, with two tillage treatments, no tillage and conventional tillage; and (C) mulch site, with two mulch treatments, mulch and no mulch. Experimental plots have received similar treatments since the sites were established (1991, 1992) and a variety of crops are grown on the sites annually. From December 1999 to November 2000, soil core samples (4.8 cm diameter) were taken randomly from the surface 10 cm of each plot every 28–71 days. Tullgren funnels were used to extract Collembola from the soil samples and the Collembola collected were identiﬁed and quantiﬁed. A total of 9650 collembolan specimens was collected from 88 samples taken at approximately 2 month intervals, averaging 60,600 Collembola per meter square, including 38 species and three probable new species. Averaged across sites and treatments, total collembolan density was greater in September than in December. Total collembolan densities were greater with no tillage versus conventional tillage and with mulch versus no mulch. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  {"id":"culik.etal2006","abstract":"Collembola have significant influences on soil microorganisms and fertility but information on these ecologically important arthropods is lacking, especially in agricultural and tropical environments. This research was conducted to identify Collembola species present in the soil of papaya orchards in Espírito Santo, Brazil, and to compare the effect of conventional and integrated production on Collembola in this Neotropical environment. Soil samples (4.8 cm diameter, 10 cm deep) were collected in February, May, August and November 2003, from papaya orchards managed with conventional production (including pesticide application based on little or no pest monitoring or consideration of environmental impact) and integrated production (including selective pesticide application only when necessary based on regular pest monitoring) in one experimental site with three treatments (conventional; integrated with drip irrigation; integrated with microsprinkler irrigation) and four commercial orchards (two with conventional and two with integrated production). Berlese-Tullgren funnels were used to extract Collembola from the soil samples. Averaged over the sampling dates, collembolan densities of the orchards ranged from 14023 to 56001 Collembola per m2. In the experimental site, the species Willemia brevispina, Folsomina cf. onychiurina, Folsomides cf. centralis, Folsomides parvulus, Cyphoderus cf. similis, and Neelus cf. minimus were more abundant with integrated versus conventional production. However, this difference was not apparent in commercial orchards sampled. Results indicate that relatively high populations and diverse communities of Collembola occur in the soil of papaya orchards in Espírito Santo but no collembolan species were found to be consistent biological indicators of conventional or integrated production. The species Acherontiella colotlipana, Willemia brevispina, Brachystomella agrosa, Friesea sublimis, Pseudostachia sp.1, Mesaphorura amazonica, Arlea sp.1, Salina sp.1, and Sphaeridia cf. pumilis are new records for the state of Espírito Santo, and Acherontiella colotlipana and Friesea sublimes, are new records for Brazil.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Culik","given":"Mark Paul"},{"family":"Martins","given":"David Dos Santos"},{"family":"Ventura","given":"José Aires"}],"citation-key":"culik.etal2006","container-title":"Biota Neotropica","container-title-short":"Biota Neotrop.","DOI":"10.1590/S1676-06032006000300019","ISSN":"1676-0603","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Collembola (Arthropoda: Hexapoda) communities in the soil of papaya orchards managed with conventional and integrated production in Espírito Santo, Brazil","title-short":"Collembola (Arthropoda","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1676-06032006000300019&lng=en&tlng=en","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"danchin.etal2018","abstract":"Despite theoretical justification for the evolution of animal culture, empirical evidence for it beyond mammals and birds remains scant, and we still know little about the process of cultural inheritance. In this study, we propose a mechanism-driven definition of animal culture and test it in the fruitfly. We found that fruitflies have five cognitive capacities that enable them to transmit mating preferences culturally across generations, potentially fostering persistent traditions (the main marker of culture) in mating preference. A transmission chain experiment validates a model of the emergence of local traditions, indicating that such social transmission may lead initially neutral traits to become adaptive, hence strongly selecting for copying and conformity. Although this situation was suggested decades ago, it previously had little empirical support.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Danchin","given":"Etienne"},{"family":"Nöbel","given":"Sabine"},{"family":"Pocheville","given":"Arnaud"},{"family":"Dagaeff","given":"Anne-Cecile"},{"family":"Demay","given":"Léa"},{"family":"Alphand","given":"Mathilde"},{"family":"Ranty-Roby","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Van Renssen","given":"Lara"},{"family":"Monier","given":"Magdalena"},{"family":"Gazagne","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Allain","given":"Mélanie"},{"family":"Isabel","given":"Guillaume"}],"citation-key":"danchin.etal2018","container-title":"Science","container-title-short":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.aat1590","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6418","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,30]]},"language":"en","page":"1025-1030","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Cultural flies: Conformist social learning in fruitflies predicts long-lasting mate-choice traditions","title-short":"Cultural flies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aat1590","volume":"362"},

  {"id":"dannibale.etal2017","abstract":"Introduction of legumes (i.e. white clover) in agricultural grasslands is a common practice to improve yields, but how this affects soil fauna populations, particularly mesofauna, is still poorly understood. We investigated taxonomical and functional differences of Collembola communities between plots with either perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), white clover (Trifolium repens L.) or a mixture of both in a Danish agricultural grassland 6 and 14 months after establishing the leys (September and May, respectively). Diet preferences were investigated via stable isotope analyses (SIA) of carbon (13C) and nitrogen (15N). Collembolan abundance data were used to analyse morphological and ecological traits of the collected taxa and calculate functional diversity indices. Our stable isotope results show that rootderived resources made larger contributions to epedaphic and hemiedaphic species in the white clover than ryegrass plots. Changes in taxa speciﬁc density and traits distribution as a response to the C:N ratio of plant material, suggest that plant material quality was the main factor affecting the collembolan community, especially when comparing the two sampling occasions. Functional richness decreased under conditions of low quality material. In contrast to our hypothesis, population densities did not increase under mixture treatment and functional richness decreased. Our results suggest that habitat changes, via different plant composition, can affect some functional groups, having in turn effects on the functional diversity of the community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"D'Annibale","given":"Alessandra"},{"family":"Sechi","given":"Valentina"},{"family":"Larsen","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Christensen","given":"Søren"},{"family":"Krogh","given":"Paul Henning"},{"family":"Eriksen","given":"Jørgen"}],"citation-key":"dannibale.etal2017","container-title":"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","container-title-short":"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","DOI":"10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.05.010","ISSN":"00380717","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9]]},"language":"en","page":"165-176","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Does introduction of clover in an agricultural grassland affect the food base and functional diversity of Collembola?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S003807171730500X","volume":"112"},

  {"id":"decaens.etal2006","abstract":"It has taken time for the international community to accept the idea of biodiversity values, a concept which had previously been restricted to the limited aesthetic and touristic aspects of wildlife. This situation changed following the International Convention on Biodiversity in Rio de Janeiro (1992), which focussed on “the forgotten environmental problem” of biodiversity erosion and made the first clear reference to the values of living species. Biodiversity values refer to direct or indirect, economic or non-economic interest, a given species or ecosystem may represent for human populations. These values are generally split into intrinsic and instrumental (use) values, the last category itself being divided into direct and indirect economic values. Obviously, each of these values carries different weights, and cannot be considered as being weighted equally in terms of justification for species or ecosystem conservation. Soil is probably one of the most species-rich habitats of terrestrial ecosystems, especially if the definition is extended to related habitats like vertebrate faeces, decaying wood, and humus of hollow trees (i.e. epiphytic soils). The diversity of soil communities (sensu lato) thus probably encompasses a large part of terrestrial animals. This highly speciose fauna has been the subject of recent research efforts, and current trends in soil fauna studies include aspects of biology, autecology, ecotoxicology, or functional ecology. During the past 20 years, recognition of the importance of soil fauna in the functioning of soils and by extension of terrestrial ecosystems has been continuously growing, ending in some important applications in agronomy. However, despite the general agreement about the ecological importance of soil fauna and its economic consequences, the absence of concern about this group from conservationists in their studies is conspicuous. This paper aims at presenting soil fauna within the scope of conservation biology concepts, trying to identify the different values of soil fauna and how they participe to the provisioning of key ecosystem services. Finally, the enormous gap between their recognised usefulness and their consideration in protection policies is discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Decaëns","given":"Thibaud"},{"family":"Jiménez","given":"J.

Second, new approaches and new tools, which are re-shaping current Collembola systematics are listed and summarised.

Important new characters have been discovered. Antennal chaetotaxy, leg chaetotaxy, dorsal chaetotaxy, S-chaetae patterns on tergites, and mouthparts have gained a prominent place in current Collembola taxonomy because of their high discriminating power. On this background and from extensive biological surveys in new areas of the world, significant results were obtained during the last three decades in terms of taxonomical discoveries, sibling species discrimination and species clusters, changes in taxonomical hierarchy, evolutionary history of the order and phylogeny of several groups.

  {"id":"delima.etal2023","abstract":"For more than three decades, major efforts in sampling and analyzing tree diversity in South America have focused almost exclusively on trees with stems of at least 10 and 2.5 cm diameter, showing highest species diversity in the wetter western and northern Amazon forests. By contrast, little attention has been paid to patterns and drivers of diversity in the largest canopy and emergent trees, which is surprising given these have dominant ecological functions. Here, we use a machine learning approach to quantify the importance of environmental factors and apply it to generate spatial predictions of the species diversity of all trees (dbh ≥ 10 cm) and for very large trees (dbh ≥ 70 cm) using data from 243 forest plots (108,450 trees and 2832 species) distributed across different forest types and biogeographic regions of the Brazilian Amazon. The diversity of large trees and of all trees was significantly associated with three environmental factors, but in contrasting ways across regions and forest types. Environmental variables associated with disturbances, for example, the lightning flash rate and wind speed, as well as the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation, tend to govern the diversity of large trees. Upland rainforests in the Guiana Shield and Roraima regions had a high diversity of large trees. By contrast, variables associated with resources tend to govern tree diversity in general. Places such as the province of Imeri and the northern portion of the province of Madeira stand out for their high diversity of species in general. Climatic and topographic stability and functional adaptation mechanisms promote ideal conditions for species diversity. Finally, we mapped general patterns of tree species diversity in the Brazilian Amazon, which differ substantially depending on size class.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"De Lima","given":"Robson Borges"},{"family":"Görgens","given":"Eric Bastos"},{"family":"Da Silva","given":"Diego Armando S."},{"family":"De Oliveira","given":"Cinthia Pereira"},{"family":"Batista","given":"Anderson Pedro B."},{"family":"Caraciolo Ferreira","given":"Rinaldo L."},{"family":"Costa","given":"Flavia R.

Termites (Isoptera) in tropical savannas are known as ecosystem engineers, affecting the spatial and temporal distribution of water, carbon, cations, and nutrients through their mound structures.

The aim of this study was to explore the ecosystem role of termitaria in determining invertebrate diversity and their potential trophic interactions. We used stable isotopes to distinguish termite-feeding invertebrates from invertebrates merely living in termite mounds under field conditions. 3. The results suggest that inquiline spiders (Arachnida) do not feed on termites directly, but on other invertebrates within the termitaria that are termitophagous, elevating the spiders three trophic levels higher than the termites. 4. This study is the first to demonstrate food web interactions among inquiline invertebrates with a stable isotope approach. It provides evidence that termites play a keystone role in the system by providing habitat for various, trophically interacting invertebrates.

  {"id":"dickens.graham2002","abstract":"The assessment of biota in rivers is a widely recognized means of determining the condition or ‘health’ of rivers. Benthic macroinvertebrates, in particular, are recognized as valuable organisms for bioassessments, due largely to their visibility to the naked eye, ease of identification, rapid life cycle often based on the seasons and their largely sedentary habits. Numerous bioassessment techniques have been developed over the last three decades, varying in complexity and region of implementation. South Africa has an exemplary history in this field, culminating in the refinement of invertebrate and other techniques and their application in a National River Health Programme. The method presented here is a refinement of the highly successful SASS (South African Scoring System) method developed by Chutter (1994), which forms the backbone of this programme. This paper takes the method to a level where it can, and has been, accredited to ISO standards. The principal changes made include the tighter definition of the technique and the sampling and analytical methods, as well as the introduction of quality control procedures. Some changes have also been made to the list of invertebrates used in this method Field trials were conducted to test the variability of the method. Of the various indices available to the method, the ASPT is the most consistent over all biotopes (lowest CV%). On the other hand, of the biotopes examined the Gravel/Sand/Mud (GSM) combination is the most variable with respect to the SASS Score and number of taxa encountered. The spatial variability on a reach of river with similar water quality characteristics was found to be statistically negligible. However, one generally finds that statistically significant differences occur between the SASS Scores and the number of taxa counted by different operators. The ASPT, on the other hand, is a more consistent and repeatable measure of river health assessment and, within a given reach of river and considering all biotopes, the differences in results produced by different operators were statistically negligible. The results highlight the need for appropriate competency-based training and consistent application of the method.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Dickens","given":"C Ws"},{"family":"Graham","given":"P M"}],"citation-key":"dickens.graham2002","container-title":"African Journal of Aquatic Science","container-title-short":"African Journal of Aquatic Science","DOI":"10.2989/16085914.2002.9626569","ISSN":"1608-5914, 1727-9364","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-10","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The South African Scoring System (SASS) Version 5 Rapid Bioassessment Method for Rivers","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2989/16085914.2002.9626569","volume":"27"},

A signiﬁcant interaction between management type and landscape context was revealed in several cases. Activity density of millipedes and wood lice and species richness of ground beetles were higher in ﬁelds where local and regional management types were complementary, indicating a beneﬁcial effect of environmental heterogeneity. In addition, seed predation on arable weeds was higher in organically than conventionally managed ﬁelds. It is concluded that the effect of agricultural management on soil arthropod biodiversity and functioning is often context dependent. The diversity of functionally important taxa such as ground beetles and decomposers may be enhanced by increasing environmental heterogeneity, a measure that is also beneﬁcial for other components of agrobiodiversity. Thus, in a conventional agricultural context even managing only a fraction of ﬁelds organically may help to increase environmental heterogeneity and thereby promote soil arthropod diversity and the associated ecosystem functions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Diekötter","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Wamser","given":"Sabine"},{"family":"Wolters","given":"Volkmar"},{"family":"Birkhofer","given":"Klaus"}],"citation-key":"diekotter.etal2010","container-title":"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","container-title-short":"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.agee.2010.01.008","ISSN":"01678809","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",4]]},"language":"en","page":"108-112","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Landscape and management effects on structure and function of soil arthropod communities in winter wheat","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167880910000241","volume":"137"},

Based on material mainly from China, we have conducted a multilocus phylogeny and topology tests with likelihood and Bayesian algorithms, and accordingly demonstrated the non-monophyly of Chinese Entomobrya. The division of five clades, including Entomobrya and several related genera, coincided well with five types of colorations, respectively.

  {"id":"djigal.etal2012","abstract":"► Conservation farming (CA) effect on soil functioning was studied through nematodes. ► We compared the soil nematodes of three CA to those of tillage (CT) and fallow (NF). ► We showed that nematodes parameters discriminated well the different systems. ► The soil functioning of CA system was intermediated between that NF and CT system. ► The CA systems were able to support better/comparable plant yields compared to CT. Conservation agriculture (CA) is rapidly developing in Madagascar but little is known about its effects on local soil functioning. To assess some of those effects, we investigated the effects of three CA systems and two levels of fertilization on soil functioning using nematofauna as indicator. The systems consisted in (i) soybean ( Glycine max L.)-maize ( Zea mays L.) rotation with mulch of residues, CA-R; (ii) bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris L.)-soybean rotation with living mulch of Pennisetum clandestinum, CA-K; (iii) continuous maize with living mulch of Desmodium uncinatum, CA-D and were compared with soybean–maize under conventional tillage (CT) and natural fallow (NF). The fertilization levels consisted in (i) farmyard manure, FYM; and (ii) farmyard manure + mineral fertilizers, FYM + NPK. Located in the Highlands of Madagascar, the experiment was setup in 1991 and andic Dystrustept soil had been sampled in 2005–2007. We measured nematode abundances and ecological indices as well as the abundance and biomass of soil macrofauna, soil water and organic C and N contents and plant yields. We hypothesized that (1) CA including maize in monoculture would lead to higher abundance of plant-parasitic nematodes; (2) both dead-residue mulch and inorganic fertilization would lead to a more basal nematode community structure; and (3) that the combination of system effects on soil nematode community would be able to forecast differential crop yields for the CA systems. Our results show that CA systems tested were able to support better/comparable maize and soybean yields compared with CT, provided that crop rotation is correctly managed. Supporting our first hypothesis, abundance of plant parasitic nematodes was (40–150 times) higher under maize monoculture. Abundance of soil nematofauna and trophic groups (excepted carnivores and omnivores) was stable during the three years. Inorganic fertilization increases carnivorous and omnivorous nematodes to 122% and 140%, respectively. Ecological indices showed that soil functioning of CA systems was intermediate between that NF and CT. CA systems were characterized by a highly structured soil food-web compared with CT. Yet, soil processes intensity revealed to be lower in CA with dead mulch compared with CA with living mulch, contrasting with our second hypothesis. The characterization of nematofauna discriminated well the different systems and supports our third hypothesis. Nematode structure and enrichment indices were significantly correlated to soil organic C and N content as well as grain yields. They proved to be powerful bio-indicators of soil functioning in the CA systems studied.","author":[{"family":"Djigal","given":"Djibril"},{"family":"Saj","given":"Stéphane"},{"family":"Rabary","given":"Bodovololona"},{"family":"Blanchart","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Villenave","given":"Cécile"}],"citation-key":"djigal.etal2012","container-title":"Soil & tillage research","event-place":"Amsterdam","ISSN":"0167-1987","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"eng","page":"11-21","publisher":"Elsevier B.V","publisher-place":"Amsterdam","title":"Mulch type affects soil biological functioning and crop yield of conservation agriculture systems in a long-term experiment in Madagascar","type":"article-journal","volume":"118"},

  {"id":"doles.etal2001","abstract":"We studied the inﬂuences of organic and conventional management practices on microarthropod diversity, densities, and dynamics in apple orchards on the Western Slope of Colorado. The ‘organic’ orchards differed from the ‘conventional’ orchards in that they used natural fertilizers (versus synthetic) and did not use insecticides and/or herbicides. Based on ﬁndings from annual agroecosystems, we hypothesized that the conventionally managed (CM) apple orchards would support a lower diversity and density of soil microarthropods than the organically managed (OM) apple orchards. We located nine sites, three OM orchards, three CM orchards, and three native sites. From each site, microarthropods were extracted from soil samples taken from June to September of 1997 and April to September of 1998. The richness and diversity of functional groups and families did not differ among the OM orchards, CM orchards and/or native sites. We did ﬁnd signiﬁcantly greater (P ≤ 0.05) densities of soil microarthropods early in growing season, June 1997 and April 1998, in the OM orchards in comparison to the CM orchards and native sites. Furthermore, the densities of predatory mites were signiﬁcantly greater in the OM orchards in comparison to both the CM orchards and native sites on selective dates throughout the period of study. Organic management practices have increased the densities of microarthropods above those found in CM orchards and native sites. These results may be due to the interaction between a greater accumulation of plant litter and organic matter in the OM orchards and the heavy pesticide use in the CM orchards. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  {"id":"du.etal2024","abstract":"Insects represent the most diverse animal group, yet previous phylogenetic analyses based on the morphological and molecular data have failed to agree on the evolutionary relationships of early insects and their six-legged relatives (together constituting the clade Hexapoda). In particular, the phylogenetic positions of the three early-diverging hexapod groups, the coneheads (Protura), springtails (Collembola), and two-pronged bristletails (Diplura), have been debated for over a century, with alternative topologies implying drastically different scenarios of the evolution of the insect body plan and hexapod terrestrialisation. We addressed this issue by sampling of all hexapod orders, and experimented with a broad range of across-site compositional heterogeneous models designed to tackle ancient divergences. Our analyses support Protura as the earliest-diverging hexapod lineage (Protura-sister) and Collembola as a sister group to the Diplura, a clade we refer to as ‘Antennomusculata’ characterised by the shared possession of internal muscles in the antennal flagellum. The universally recognized ‘Ellipura’ hypothesis is recovered under the site-homogenous LG model. Our cross-validation analysis shows that the CAT-GTR model that recovers Protura-sister fits significantly better than homogenous model. Furthermore, as a very unusual group, Protura as the first diverging lineage of hexapods is also supported by other lines of evidence, such as mitogenomics, comparative embryology, and sperm morphology. The backbone phylogeny of hexapods recovered in this study will facilitate the exploration of the underpinnings of hexapod terrestrialisation and mega-diversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Du","given":"Shiyu"},{"family":"Tihelka","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Daoyuan"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Wan-Jun"},{"family":"Bu","given":"Yun"},{"family":"Cai","given":"Chenyang"},{"family":"Engel","given":"Michael S."},{"family":"Luan","given":"Yun-Xia"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Feng"}],"citation-key":"du.etal2024","DOI":"10.1101/2024.01.08.574592","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,8]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2024, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

  {"id":"dunfield.germida2003","abstract":"ABSTRACT\n            The\nintroduction of transgenic plants into agricultural ecosystems has\nraised the question of the ecological impact of these plants on\nnontarget organisms, such as soil bacteria. Although differences in\nboth the genetic structure and the metabolic function of the microbial\ncommunities associated with some transgenic plant lines have been\nestablished, it remains to be seen whether these differences have an\necological impact on the soil microbial communities. We conducted a\n2-year, multiple-site field study in which rhizosphere samples\nassociated with a transgenic canola variety and a conventional canola\nvariety were sampled at six times throughout the growing season. The\nobjectives of this study were to identify differences between the\nrhizosphere microbial community associated with the transgenic plants\nand the rhizosphere microbial community associated with the\nconventional canola plants and to determine whether the differences\nwere permanent or depended on the presence of the plant.\nCommunity-level physiological profiles, fatty acid methyl ester\nprofiles, and terminal amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis\nprofiles of rhizosphere microbial communities were compared to the\nprofiles of the microbial community associated with an unplanted,\nfallow field plot.

The invasion of a generalist predator creates a unique opportunity to study the effects of predation across these subsystems. We examine here, the effects of a non-native generalist predator, the little red fire ant (Wasmannia auropunctata, Roger) on both grazing and detrital invertebrate communities and ecosystem processes in a rain forest understorey. Gamba Protected Area Complex, south-western Gabon, Africa. We measured abundances and diversities of understorey grazing and detrital invertebrate communities, soil nutrients, herbivory, litter fragmentation rates and leaf chemistry of a dominant understorey shrub inside and outside of 19 separate invasion fronts. We then explored possible trophic cascades and pathways of interaction using path analysis. Results suggest that invasive ants may alter herbivory regimes, grazing and detrital communities, and may indirectly alter litter decomposition and nutrient cycling in the soil by suppressing important microbivore and detritivore populations with consequences for leaf chemistry. These results demonstrate that generalist predators may be major drivers of both grazing and detrital subsystems by inducing strong shifts in adjacent communities that ultimately affect ecosystem processes.","author":[{"family":"Dunham","given":"Amy E"},{"family":"Mikheyev","given":"Alexander S"}],"citation-key":"dunham.mikheyev2010","container-title":"Diversity & distributions","event-place":"Oxford, UK","ISSN":"1366-9516","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"eng","page":"33-42","publisher":"Oxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher-place":"Oxford, UK","title":"Influence of an invasive ant on grazing and detrital communities and nutrient fluxes in a tropical forest","type":"article-journal","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"dutour.etal2021","abstract":"Many group-living individuals produce specific vocalizations while mobbing (when individuals move toward and harass a predator), a behavior that can recruit conspecifics. Although these vocalizations may be a source of information for heterospecifics, it remains largely unknown how heterospecifics respond to mobbing calls given by group-living species. In this study, we investigate whether the mobbing calls given by Western Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen dorsalis) lead to the recruitment of heterospecifics. By presenting a taxidermied red fox (Vulpes vulpes)—representing a terrestrial predator threat—to a population of magpies and heterospecific species occupying the same area, we demonstrate that magpie calls given in response to a terrestrial predator recruit heterospecifics to the mobbing event. Heterospecifics are more likely to approach and engage in mobbing behavior when the predator is associated with magpie presence than when magpies are absent. We found that larger magpie groups produced more alarm calls than did smaller groups, but we found no evidence that group size affected heterospecific recruitment to the mobbing site. Therefore, the occurrence of magpie alarm calls, rather than the number of individuals giving alarm calls, seems to be the primary predictor of heterospecific recruitment to a mobbing site. Moreover, we used a playback experiment to test if heterospecifics responded more to single-magpie mobbing alarm calls than to single mobbing alarm calls given by a non-social species (red wattlebird, Anthochaera carunculata). We found that heterospecifics responded more to the playbacks of magpie than to red wattlebird alarm calls. Our study therefore suggests that Australian magpies may play a central role as information sources for heterospecific species during predator detection and mobbing events.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Dutour","given":"Mylène"},{"family":"Kasper","given":"Jasmine"},{"family":"Ridley","given":"Amanda R."}],"citation-key":"dutour.etal2021","container-title":"Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology","container-title-short":"Behav Ecol Sociobiol","DOI":"10.1007/s00265-021-03075-4","ISSN":"0340-5443, 1432-0762","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10]]},"language":"en","page":"137","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Transfer of information between a highly social species and heterospecific community members","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00265-021-03075-4","volume":"75"},

  {"id":"erasmus2021","abstract":"Understanding the dynamics of plant survival between early post-fire vegetation to maturation is important for the conservation of threatened habitats in the CFR. Data were obtained from a plant demography experiment conducted across two habitats in the Klein Karoo spanning 2.5 years. Surveys were conducted twice a year. Twenty-four plots shared between fynbos and renosterveld sites were established, half of which were experimental plots. The experimental setup aimed to reduce rainfall seasonality via winter rainfall capture and summer irrigation. An algorithm was developed to retrospectively mark plants over the time series. The algorithm was informed by easily extracted growth data and aimed to infer the identity of individual plants. The mortality of an individual plant was then determined and the survival of the plant at each time interval was modelled using logistic regression. Variables that were tested included survey, recruitment strategy (resprouts versus seedlings), age of plant, plot treatment, and site. I found that time-since-fire heavily influenced mortality, as the odds of dying over the first time period decreased by 90% in the following time period. Additionally, older resprouts and plants in experimental treatment plots had significantly lower mortality rates. In the experimental plots, mortality began rising in the later surveys. This may have been due to subsequent germination events made possible by the increased humidity provided by the simulated rain events. Off-season or premature fires resulting from climate change may compounded the early mortality. Therefore, intervention in such cases may be warranted to maintain biodiversity.","author":[{"family":"Erasmus","given":"Dean Arnó"}],"citation-key":"erasmus2021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"University of Cape Town","source":"Zotero","title":"Estimating mortality from demographic data of unmarked plants","type":"thesis"},

At each burrow cluster and paired control site without burrows, we estimated plant cover, height, and richness using quadrats, and invertebrate and small mammal abundance and richness using pit-fall traps and mark-recapture, respectively. We determined nitrogen concentrations in grasses on and off burrows and measured carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in plants and squirrel hair to determine squirrel diet. Burrows had greater plant cover and richness, particularly more shrubby vegetation, but plant height and nitrogen concentrations did not differ on and off burrows. Invertebrate and small mammal abundance and richness were greater on burrows. Squirrel disturbances in semi-arid grassland improved conditions for disturbance-dependent shrubs, which were rarely consumed by squirrels but are valuable forage for antelope and provide cover for invertebrates and small mammals.

  {"id":"famin.etal2022","abstract":"The construction of ocean island basaltic volcanoes consists of a succession of eruptions, intrusions, and metamorphism. These events are often temporally ill-constrained because the most widely used radiometric dating methods applicable to mafic volcanic rocks (K-Ar or 40Ar/39Ar on whole rock or groundmass) are prone to inaccuracy when applied to slowly cooled, altered, or vesicular and aphyric products. Here, we adopt a multitechnique geochronology approach (including zircon U-Pb, phlogopite 40Ar/39Ar, zircon and apatite (U-Th)/He, and zircon double-dating) to demonstrate its efficacy when applied to basaltic volcanoes. Taking the main volcano of Réunion Island (Piton des Neiges) as a case study, we establish the time of the major plutonic, metamorphic, and explosive events that had resisted previous dating attempts. We document four stages of pluton emplacement and metamorphism at 2,200–2,000 ka, 1,414 ± 8 ka, 665 ± 78 ka, and 150–110 ka, all coinciding with volcanism revival after quiescent intervals. We also date a major Plinian eruption at 188.2 ± 10.4 ka, coeval with the formation age of a large caldera, and, finally, we constrain the last eruption of Piton des Neiges to 27 ka, revising a previous estimate of 12 ka. By resolving several conundrums of Réunion's geological history, our multitechnique geochronology approach reveals that endogenous growth of a volcanic island proceeds as pulses at the beginning of renewed volcanism. We also demonstrate that crosschecking eruptions ages by diversified dating techniques is important to better assess the timing and recurrence of basaltic volcanic activity, with implications for hazard prediction. © 2022 The Authors.","author":[{"family":"Famin","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Paquez","given":"Camille"},{"family":"Danišík","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Gardiner","given":"Nicholas J."},{"family":"Michon","given":"Laurent"},{"family":"Kirkland","given":"Christopher L."},{"family":"Berthod","given":"Carole"},{"family":"Friedrichs","given":"Bjarne"},{"family":"Schmitt","given":"Axel K."},{"family":"Monié","given":"Patrick"}],"citation-key":"famin.etal2022","container-title":"Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems","container-title-short":"Geochem.

The genetic variability and its structure in the common springtail I.minor were investigated on a regional geographic scale using mitochondrial (COI) and nuclear (28S rDNA) markers. A total of nine populations from urban habitats of the Košice city agglomeration and four populations from natural sites of the karst landscape were used for the present study carried out in the Western Carpathians, Slovakia. Up to nine cryptic lineages (MOTUs - molecular operational taxonomic units) were independently recognised by two molecular delimitation methods. In addition, high genetic distances between lineages were observed (p-dist: 10.87−22.75% and K2p: 11.98−27.22%), comparable to the genetic distances between species. This study showed that urban and natural habitats harbour significantly different genetic lineages. Limited dispersal of MOTUs (lineages) between natural and urban populations was also supported by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). While the I.minor populations at urban sites were mixtures of different lineages, the populations at natural sites were monophyletic and their haplotypes/genetic lineages were clearly grouped by individual sites. Possible ecological filtering between urban and natural environments within MOTUs is discussed with respect to the evolution of parthenogenetic species I.minor in this habitat complex.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Fedičová","given":"Mária"},{"family":"Raschmanová","given":"Natália"},{"family":"Žurovcová","given":"Martina"},{"family":"Šustr","given":"Vladimír"},{"family":"Kováč","given":"Ľubomír"}],"citation-key":"fedicova.etal2025","container-title":"ZooKeys","container-title-short":"Zookeys","DOI":"10.3897/zookeys.1245.152112","ISSN":"1313-2989","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,14]]},"page":"19-39","PMCID":"PMC12280966","PMID":"40703783","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Structure of the genetic variation in the common springtail Isotomiellaminor (Hexapoda, Collembola) from contrasting habitats: evidence for different genetic lineages at a regional scale?","title-short":"Structure of the genetic variation in the common springtail Isotomiellaminor (Hexapoda, Collembola) from contrasting habitats","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12280966/","volume":"1245"},

Biological invasions are one of the main threats to biodiversity loss on this island and globally worldwide. This study aimed to quantify invasion degree by alien plants species in Reunion Island. This work was possible thanks to a large partnership between researchers and managers. All existing spatial data on invasion pattern were combined and completed by expert knowledge to develop the ﬁrst 250 x 250 m map of invasion degree at the island scale. To ﬁll the gaps where no ﬁeld survey data or expert knowledge was available, we used a Random Forest model using nine climatic, landscape and anthropogenic variables. This model also provides a preliminary assessment of drivers of invasion at Reunion Island. Results showed that 85% of the extant native vegetation was invaded in different proportions; 38% are slightly invaded, 26% moderately invaded and 22% very heavily invaded. Despite the high levels of invasion in some places, more than 50% of the extant vegetation is not invaded or slightly invaded. Most of the invaded areas are located in the lowland and in the leeward coast although alien plants invade all types of vegetation from the coast to the top of the island. These results highlight a clear increase in the distribution of alien species over time.

  {"id":"fernandes.etal2009","abstract":"The objectives of this work were to evaluate the richness and diversity of the Poduromorpha fauna in two biotopes in Restinga de Maricá, RJ, Brazil, to identify the characteristic species of each biotope and to determine the relationships between the community structure and the abiotic environmental parameters. Representatives of the Poduromorpha (Collembola) order were studied under an ecological viewpoint in halophyte-psammophyte vegetation and foredune zone in preserved areas of Restinga de Maricá, a sand dune environment in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The foredune zone showed the highest diversity, richness and equitability of springtail species. Differences in the fundamental, accessory and accidental species in each environment were encountered. Paraxenylla piloua was found to be an indicator species of the halophyte-psammophyte vegetation, while Friesea reducta, Pseudachorutes difficilis and Xenylla maritima were indicators of the foredune zone. The canonical correspondence analysis indicated pH, organic matter content and soil humidity as the most important factors influencing the spatiotemporal distribution of the species.\n          , \n            Os objetivos deste trabalho foram avaliar a riqueza e a diversidade da fauna de Poduromorpha em dois biótopos na Restinga de Maricá, RJ, identificar as espécies características de cada biótopo e determinar as relações da estrutura da comunidade com parâmetros ambientais abióticos.

However, the continuous increase in cave visitation is severely impacting the system as evidenced by graffiti, the trampling and destruction of cave habitats and even a reduction in the sizes of bat colonies. In October 2019, the Wynberg Cave System was visited by a group of scientist, who discovered unregistered troglomorphic species. This, subsequently increased the number of troglobites occurring in the system to 19, which likely means that this system has the potential to become the first hotspot of subterranean biodiversity in Africa.

  {"id":"fierer.etal2009","abstract":"Although belowground ecosystems have been studied extensively and soil biota play integral roles in biogeochemical processes, surprisingly we have a limited understanding of global patterns in belowground biomass and community structure. To address this critical gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of published data (> 1300 datapoints) to compare belowground plant, microbial and faunal biomass across seven of the major biomes on Earth. We also assembled data to assess biome-level patterns in belowground microbial community composition. Our analysis suggests that variation in microbial biomass is predictable across biomes, with microbial biomass carbon representing 0.6–1.1% of soil organic carbon (r2 = 0.91) and 1–20% of total plant biomass carbon (r2 = 0.42). Approximately 50% of total animal biomass can be found belowground and soil faunal biomass represents < 4% of microbial biomass across all biomes. The structure of belowground microbial communities is also predictable: bacterial community composition and fungal : bacterial gene ratios can be predicted reasonably well from soil pH and soil C : N ratios respectively. Together these results identify robust patterns in the structure of belowground microbial and faunal communities at broad scales which may be explained by universal mechanisms that regulate belowground biota across biomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Fierer","given":"Noah"},{"family":"Strickland","given":"Michael S."},{"family":"Liptzin","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Bradford","given":"Mark A."},{"family":"Cleveland","given":"Cory C."}],"citation-key":"fierer.etal2009","container-title":"Ecology Letters","DOI":"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01360.x","ISSN":"1461-0248","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"language":"en","page":"1238-1249","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Global patterns in belowground communities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01360.x","volume":"12"},

This study relies on the relationships between Collembola community structures and land use systems as a proxy for characterizing changes in soil quality. Thus, Collembola community structure (eco-morphological groups – edaphic, hemiedaphic and epigeic, and morphotypes) were examined in a no-tillage system and crop-livestock integration system to evaluate the discriminative power of the Collembola community structure and to determine which soil properties drives structural diversity. Thirty-eight morphotypes of Collembola were recorded in this study, 11 belonging to the edaphic eco-morphological group, 14 hemiedaphic, and 13 epigeic. The hemiedaphic and epigeic groups, in the no-tillage system, were more influenced by changes in soil properties (total organic carbon, particulate organic carbon, total N, Ca, Mg, moisture, bulk density) and mycelium length than the groups in the crop-livestock integration system (mycorrhizal inoculum potential, and soil properties as dehydrogenase, particulate organic carbon, Mg, sand). Collembola eco-morphological groups were better predictors for ecosystem functioning than Collembola density and can be used to distinguish differences between soil uses, reducing laboratory analysis time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Filho","given":"Luís Carlos Iuñes De Oliveira"},{"family":"Filho","given":"Osmar Klauberg"},{"family":"Baretta","given":"Dilmar"},{"family":"Tanaka","given":"Cynthia Akemi Shinozaki"},{"family":"Sousa","given":"José Paulo"}],"citation-key":"filho.etal2016","container-title":"Revista Brasileira de Ciência do Solo","container-title-short":"Rev.

  {"id":"filser.etal2002","abstract":"An arable landscape Ž150 ha. comprising a broad variety of soil types had been cultivated conventionally for many years. A small section had been intensively managed Žhops., while another had been used as grassland. For 2 years at the beginning of our study, all arable land was cultivated with cereals only. After that, management was changed to integrated or organic farming, grassland or fallow land. Within a group of sites representing the variety of soil types and management systems, the development of soil microorganisms and Collembola was monitored every spring during an 8-year period. The microbial biomass compared to initial conditions under uniform management increased, particularly in land that had been set aside. General Collembola abundance slightly decreased, except for areas that had been converted to integrated farming. Protaphorura armata and Lepidocyrtus cyaneus decreased over the entire area, whereas the Isotoma Õiridis group was positively affected by conversion to integrated farming. Although recorded only once per year, the main results were comparable to data recorded in this area at higher temporal or spatial resolution. Nevertheless, site conditions may influence the reactions of soil organisms to land use change, and should be taken into account for evaluation. Biota resident in the upper 0–10 cm of the soil reflected current management practice, whereas those at greater soil depth reflected instead management history and soil properties. The microbial biomass and abundance of selected Collembola taxa were modeled using artificial intelligence methods Žregression trees.. Land management type was the most important factor determining soil biota performance. The variation of Collembola abundance depended additionally on microbial biomass.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Filser","given":"J"},{"family":"Mebes","given":"K.-H"},{"family":"Winter","given":"K"},{"family":"Lang","given":"A"},{"family":"Kampichler","given":"C"}],"citation-key":"filser.etal2002","container-title":"Geoderma","container-title-short":"Geoderma","DOI":"10.1016/S0016-7061(01)00104-5","ISSN":"00167061","issue":"3-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",2]]},"language":"en","page":"201-221","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Long-term dynamics and interrelationships of soil Collembola and microorganisms in an arable landscape following land use change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016706101001045","volume":"105"},

However, sampling methods involving the extractions of soil are becoming increasingly difficult to implement and standardise due to the lack of commercially available equipment. Moreover, they are poorly suited to repeated sampling in the same locations and underestimate more mobile taxa. Below-ground (hypogean) pitfall trapping is a promising new technique that up to now was only attempted with bulky custom-manufactured tools. In the present work we test a cheap and easily deployable setup made using standard pipe fittings. The new design was compared across different environments with Berlese/Tullgren extractions in order to ascertain whether they produce similar species lists and detect the same environment-induced changes in communities. The two trap types were found to yield structurally different assemblages, with the new design producing significantly higher abundance and diversity of springtails and larger taxa. Beta-diversity profiles resulted however perfectly comparable, characterising the same pattern of dissimilarities. In addition, a new method is proposed to use the two sampling types in combination to estimate the dispersal of soil organisms. Below-ground pitfall traps have the potential to complement Berlese extractions for reliable and standardised monitoring of soil arthropods, thanks to their effectiveness, low cost and ease of operation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Fioratti Junod","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Reid","given":"Brian J."},{"family":"Sims","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Anthony J."}],"citation-key":"fiorattijunod.etal2023","container-title":"Pedobiologia","container-title-short":"Pedobiologia","DOI":"10.1016/j.pedobi.2023.150911","ISSN":"0031-4056","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,1]]},"page":"150911","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Below-ground pitfall traps for standardised monitoring of soil mesofauna: Design and comparison to Berlese/Tullgren funnels","title-short":"Below-ground pitfall traps for standardised monitoring of soil mesofauna","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031405623079799","volume":"101"},

The island has an urgent need to conserve its surviving remnants of native terrestrial habitats. There, however, exists little published quantitative information like species diversity, stem density and basal area in these habitats and other essential parameters for informing their conservation. We surveyed woody native plants in five of the best preserved lowland wet forests using 75 random plots of 100 m2 (totalling 0.75 ha). Density, dominance and frequency values were calculated along with species and family importance values for each site. For plants ≥1 cm diameter at breast height, 108 species in 66 genera and 39 families were represented by 6,000 individual plants. This gives a density of 8,000 plants per ha which is very high for a lowland wet tropical forest. Species endemism within the plots was 63 % to Mauritius and 87 % to the Mascarenes. Some 56 % of all woody native species ever recorded from the lowland wet forest of Mauritius was sampled. Extrapolated basal area varied from 31 to 49.1 m2 per ha. The mean similarity in species between pairs of sites was about 60 %. Mauritian wet forests retain the highest tree diversity in the Mascarenes, and probably among all isolated oceanic islands around the world despite massive habitat destruction, extraction and invasion by alien species.

  {"id":"flynn.etal2011","abstract":"How closely does variability in ecologically important traits reﬂect evolutionary divergence? The use of phylogenetic diversity (PD) to predict biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning, and more generally the use of phylogenetic information in community ecology, depends in part on the answer to this question. However, comparisons of the predictive power of phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity (FD) have not been conducted across a range of experiments. To address how phylogenetic diversity and functional trait variation control biodiversity effects on biomass production, we summarized the results of 29 grassland plant experiments where both the phylogeny of plant species used in the experiments is well described and where extensive trait data are available. Functional trait variation was only partially related to phylogenetic distances between species, and the resulting FD values therefore correlate only partially with PD. Despite these differences, FD and PD predicted biodiversity effects across all experiments with similar strength, including in subsets that excluded plots with legumes and that focused on fertilization experiments. Two- and threetrait combinations of the ﬁve traits used here (leaf nitrogen percentage, height, speciﬁc root length, leaf mass per unit area, and nitrogen ﬁxation) resulted in the FD values with the greatest predictive power.

  {"id":"frampton2000","abstract":"Counts of several Collembola species in a rotation of grass and wheat cropping were consistently lower under a conventional regime of pesticide use than under a reducedinput regime. During a six-year period (1991–1996), counts of Entomobrya nicoleti remained at or close to zero under the conventional regime. This raised the question of how long recovery would take if conventional pesticide inputs ceased. To answer this question, and confirm effects of the pesticide regimes on patchily-distributed species, the two pesticide regimes were reversed spatially: from 1997 to 1999 the area formerly under conventional inputs subsequently received the reduced-input regime and vice versa. This paper presents results up to summer 1998 to show the effect on collembolan counts of reversing the pesticide regimes. Responses varied among species: after conversion of the conventional regime to reduced inputs, counts of E. nicoleti remained at or close to zero whereas counts of Isotoma viridis were the highest recorded during the study. Data from a rotation of cereals and break crops show that reversal of treatments can aid interpretation of pesticide effects for species with a patchy temporal distribution; treatment reversal improved confidence in the interpretation of pesticide effects for species of Collembola which were not present during the pre-treatment sampling phase of a long-term study.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Frampton","given":"Geoff K."}],"citation-key":"frampton2000","container-title":"Pedobiologia","container-title-short":"Pedobiologia","DOI":"10.1078/S0031-4056(04)70066-9","ISSN":"00314056","issue":"3-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",1]]},"language":"en","page":"489-501","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Recovery responses of soil surface Collembola after spatial and temporal changes in long-term regimes of pesticide use","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0031405604700669","volume":"44"},

Current farm practice (CFP) represented conventional fungicide and herbicide use plus applications of organophosphorus (OP) insecticides, whereas reduced input approach (RIA) utilised minimum inputs of fungicides and herbicides and excluded any use of insecticides. Compared with RIA, the CFP regime caused a substantial decline in the abundance and diversity of Collembola in the ﬁeld, including the local disappearance of one species, without recovery during the study. At the ﬁeld edge, which was protected during OP applications by a 6-m unsprayed buffer zone, effects of the CFP regime were less severe, and were not persistent in the long term. Some Collembola species occurred only in ﬁeld-edge samples. Pitfall and suction sampling yielded remarkably similar patterns of catches, indicating that pitfall trapping may be appropriate for detecting long-term changes in collembolan abundance caused by intensive agricultural management practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Frampton","given":"Geoff K"}],"citation-key":"frampton2002","container-title":"Pest Management Science","container-title-short":"Pest Management Science","DOI":"10.1002/ps.580","ISSN":"1526-498X, 1526-4998","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",10]]},"language":"en","page":"991-1001","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Long‐term impacts of an organophosphate‐based regime of pesticides on field and field‐edge Collembola communities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ps.580","volume":"58"},

Diversified agricultural systems supported 600 million more years of evolutionary history than intensive monocultures but 300 million fewer years than forests. Compared with species with many extant relatives, evolutionarily distinct species were extirpated at higher rates in both diversified and intensive agricultural systems.

  {"id":"frouz2018","abstract":"Soil fauna consumes substantial amounts of litter and can even consume the entire annual litterfall in some ecosystems. The assimilation efficiency of fauna may reach 50% but is usually much smaller. Soil fauna may affect soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics not only by assimilating litter but also by modifying the soil environment at many spatiotemporal scales. Litter processing by fauna usually results in a short-term increase in microbial activity in feces; this activity than decreases such that feces over the long term may decompose more slowly than the original litter. During passage through the guts of litter-feeding fauna, litter modifications include fragmentation, consumption of associated microorganisms, pH and redox changes, removal of easily decomposed polysaccharides, increase in the proportion of lignin, and decrease in soluble polyphenols and carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratios. The coating of litter with clay during passage through earthworms reduces microbial access to the litter as well as conditions for microbial activity by reducing the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen. At a larger scale, soil fauna affects leaching and the release of particulate organic matter (POM), which in turn affect microbial activity in soil. Fauna also affects the distribution of organic matter in the soil profile and determine whether litter decomposes on the soil surface or as POM bound to soil particles, which substantially affects the microbial community and the rate of decomposition. Fauna affects the amount of organic matter entering different SOM pools, and this effect depends on litter quality and the degree of soil C saturation. At an even larger scale, fauna can change the soil profile, soil properties, and the plant community, which may in turn affect microbial activity and the decomposition rate. The effect of soil fauna on litter decomposition and soil C storage can be positive or negative. Faunal effects tend to be greatest in ecosystems under transition, e.g. ecosystem developing after some disturbance during primary or secondary succession.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Frouz","given":"Jan"}],"citation-key":"frouz2018","container-title":"Geoderma","container-title-short":"Geoderma","DOI":"10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.08.039","ISSN":"0016-7061","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,15]]},"language":"en","page":"161-172","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Effects of soil macro- and mesofauna on litter decomposition and soil organic matter stabilization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706116306668","volume":"332"},

Protura are quite common but very rarely abundant: their mean density in soil samples collected in Liguria (NW Italy) was estimated to be 372 /m² (s.d. 657 – max. 2790 /m² in a Holm oak forest). Information from the analyses of habitat and/or elevation of 3448 specimens from 269 collections and 4071 specimens from 295 collections identified to species and genus level, respectively, enabled us to outline Protura assemblages for eight different macro-habitats. The unbalanced sex ratio in favour of females observed in 12 of the dominant species of Acerentomata suggests that (based also on the sperm types known in Protura) a single male can fertilize several females through spermatophores. For one species (Proturentomon minimum) only females were collected, which may suggest the possibility of parthenogenesis in some Protura. An analysis of the phenology and population dynamics of the five dominant species, showed annual cycles with one (Acerentomon microrhinus) or more (A. gallicum, A. italicum, A. maius and Eosentomon transitorium) peaks of reproductive activity.

  {"id":"genung.etal2020","abstract":"Aim Decades of experimental research have conclusively shown a positive relationship between species richness and ecosystem function. However, authoritative reviews find no consensus on how species loss affects function in natural communities. We analyse experimental and observational data in an identical way and test whether they produce similar results. Location North America and Europe (experimental communities); global (natural communities). Time period Experimental communities: 1998–2013; natural communities: 1982–2018. Major taxa studied Experimental communities: temperate grassland plants; natural communities: temperate grassland plants, tropical forest trees, kelp forest producers and native bees. Methods We used an approach inspired by the Price equation to analyse 129 datasets from experimental and natural communities worldwide. We tested how the effects of species loss on ecosystem function varied with dominance and the non-randomness of species loss and, in turn, how these two factors differed between experiments and observations. Results Studies carried out in experimental and natural communities reached different conclusions regarding the effects of species loss. First, species loss had greater effects on ecosystem function in experiments than in nature. Second, the importance of species loss was negatively correlated with dominance in nature because as dominance increased, lost species were increasingly those contributing little to ecosystem function. Although experimental and natural communities exhibited similar levels of dominance, an analogous relationship was not possible in experiments because the order of species loss was randomized by design. Main conclusions Species loss was sometimes, but not always, the major driver of loss of function in nature. Variation in the importance of species loss was not messy and context dependent; instead, it was predicted by functional dominance. Although results from experimental and natural communities were similar in several key ways, they differed in that species loss was a consistent predictor of ecosystem function in experiments and not in nature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Genung","given":"Mark A."},{"family":"Fox","given":"Jeremy"},{"family":"Winfree","given":"Rachael"}],"citation-key":"genung.etal2020","container-title":"Global Ecology and Biogeography","DOI":"10.1111/geb.13137","ISSN":"1466-8238","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","page":"1531-1541","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Species loss drives ecosystem function in experiments, but in nature the importance of species loss depends on dominance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.13137","volume":"29"},

  {"id":"gerlach.etal2013","abstract":"Bioindicators, as taxa or functional groups, are widely used as indicators of environmental change, speciﬁc ecological factors or taxonomic diversity. The use of ecological, environmental and biodiversity indicators, is reviewed here. Although indicator taxa are considered to be generally unreliable as broad indicators of biodiversity, they may serve a useful function in identifying ecological characteristics or monitoring the effects of habitat management. Use of only a narrow range of taxa may be unreliable, and is particularly vulnerable to distortion by a small number of invasive species. Taxa also need to be selected to reﬂect the speciﬁc ecosystem being studied. It is recommended that isopods be used for soil systems (if there is sufﬁcient local diversity), in some areas earthworms or mites may be useable but are generally too difﬁcult to identify to be practically useful. In the ground layer indicator sets could include ants, millipedes, molluscs (snails in particular), ground beetles, harvestmen and gnaphosid spiders. Foliage-inhabiting indicators could comprise ants, chrysomelid leaf beetles, theridiid spiders and arctiid moths. Ants, orthopterans and butterﬂies may be appropriate for use in open habitats. These basic sets should be supplemented by other taxa where appropriate resources and taxonomic expertise are available.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Gerlach","given":"Justin"},{"family":"Samways","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Pryke","given":"James"}],"citation-key":"gerlach.etal2013","container-title":"Journal of Insect Conservation","container-title-short":"J Insect Conserv","DOI":"10.1007/s10841-013-9565-9","ISSN":"1366-638X, 1572-9753","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",8]]},"language":"en","page":"831-850","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Terrestrial invertebrates as bioindicators: an overview of available taxonomic groups","title-short":"Terrestrial invertebrates as bioindicators","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10841-013-9565-9","volume":"17"},

Checking for spatial autocorrelation is an important step in the statistical analysis of spatial data. Several statistics to achieve this goal have been proposed. The test based on the Mantel statistic is widely known and used in this context. This paper proposes an application of this test to the case of spatial functional data. Although we focus particularly on geostatistical functional data, that is functional data observed in a region with spatial continuity, the test proposed can also be applied with functional data which can be measured on a discrete set of areas of a region (areal functional data) by deﬁning properly the distance between the areas. Based on two simulation studies, we show that the proposed test has a good performance.

  {"id":"gleeson.etal2023","abstract":"The larvae of the copper-tailed blowfly (Chrysomya chloropyga) have the potential to break down high-risk waste such as abattoir waste and ameliorate the nutrients to be reintroduced into the food chain by including them in broiler feeds. Chrysomya chloropyga larvae were grown on abattoir waste, harvested, processed, and included in broiler diets at inclusion rates of either 5, 10 or 15%. Thereafter the carcass traits, meat quality characteristics and descriptive sensory attributes were determined. Further to this the mineral content of the tibia, as well as the tibia bone strength were determined. The highest inclusion rate of 15% resulted in broiler carcass and meat characteristics that were on par with a formulated soya-based control diet. The chemical composition of the meat was predominantly not significantly affected by the dietary larval meal inclusion (p > 0.05). In terms of its sensory attributes, meat from broilers fed C. chloropyga meal showed some significant differences for chicken aroma and initial juiciness (p ≤ 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed for any of five other sensory attributes of importance. Interestingly, the dietary inclusion of C. chloropyga meal was significantly related to increased tibia potassium and iron content, which could be linked to the insects’ accumulating these minerals present in the abattoir waste. The results indicate that C. chloropyga larval meal could be included in broiler diets at up to 15% without any negative effects on the aforementioned characteristics and could even influence them positively.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Gleeson","given":"Elizabeth Yvonne"},{"family":"Van Der Merwe","given":"Ajw"},{"family":"Hoffman","given":"Louwrens"},{"family":"Pieterse","given":"Elsje"}],"citation-key":"gleeson.etal2023","container-title":"African Entomology","container-title-short":"Afr.

  {"id":"godeiro.etal2023","abstract":"Entomobryoidea has been the focus of phylogenetic studies in recent years owing to a divergence between morphological and genetic data. Recent phylogenies have converged on the sister relationship of Orchesellidae with the remaining Entomobryoidea, and on the non-monophyly of the traditional Paronellidae and Entomobryidae, but still lack resolution. Known molecular phylogenies of the superfamily differ greatly between mitogenomic and multilocus markers. For this reason, we designed universal single-copy orthologue (USCO) and ultraconserved element (UCE) marker sets speciﬁc for Entomobryoidea, based on 11 genome assemblies. Upon the newly designed 3406 USCOs and 4030 UCEs, we analysed 34 species covering all Entomobryoidea families and major subfamilies. New data for 26 species were mined from whole-genome sequencing. Phylogenetic inference conﬁrmed the Orchesellidae as an independent family and the Entomobryinae remained the most puzzling taxon gathering scaled and unscaled lineages of both traditional Entomobryidae and Paronellidae. To accommodate Paronellides, Zhuqinia and related genera, Paronellidinae subfam. nov. is proposed within Entomobryidae. The sampled representatives of Paronellinae were recovered as the sister group of (Seirinae+Lepidocyrtinae), suggesting that reduction on the dorsal macrochaetotaxy and trunk sensillar pattern may have occurred independently within the Lepidocyrtinae and Paronellinae or represent their symplesiomorphy posteriorly modiﬁed in the Seirinae. The current systematics of the superfamily are revised here, with Entomobryidae now comprising six subfamilies, including all taxa with smooth dens. Our data also point out that all the main events of cladogenesis of the families and subfamilies of Entomobryoidea occurred during the Jurassic. Our genome-scale phylogenomics provides a complete, reliable example for systematics of Entomobryoidea, as well as other invertebrates in the big data era.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Godeiro","given":"Nerivania Nunes"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Yinhuan"},{"family":"Cipola","given":"Nikolas Gioia"},{"family":"Jantarit","given":"Sopark"},{"family":"Bellini","given":"Bruno Cavalcante"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Feng"}],"citation-key":"godeiro.etal2023","container-title":"Cladistics","container-title-short":"Cladistics","DOI":"10.1111/cla.12521","ISSN":"0748-3007, 1096-0031","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4]]},"language":"en","page":"101-115","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Phylogenomics and systematics of Entomobryoidea (Collembola): marker design, phylogeny and classification","title-short":"Phylogenomics and systematics of Entomobryoidea (Collembola)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cla.12521","volume":"39"},

  {"id":"gruner.etal2005","abstract":"Abstract. 1. Nutrient resource availability and host-plant foliar pubescence both influence arthropod food webs, but multifactor studies are needed to understand their interdependence and relative importance. Arthropods were sampled by clipping foliage from Metrosideros polymorpha (Myrtaceae) trees of pubescent, glabrous, and intermediate leaf forms on fertilised and unfertilised plots. 2. Fertilisation decreased leaf mass per area (LMA) but did not change the relative mass of pubescence within leaf morphological classes. 3. Fertilisation increased densities of individuals in four taxonomic orders, densities of individuals and species of all trophic levels, and the biomass of Collembola and Homoptera. Herbivore relative diversity (Shannon H′) also increased with fertilisation, but detritivore diversity declined due to increasing dominance of Salina celebensis (Schaeffer) (Collembola). 4. Detritivore density, driven again by S. celebensis, increased with decreasing leaf pubescence, but Heteroptera and Acari were most abundant on the intermediate pubescence class, and Psocoptera density and biomass increased with increasing pubescence. Trophic-level species density did not change with leaf morphological class, but relative diversity of all arthropods and of detritivores increased with increasing pubescence. 5. Both resource availability and leaf pubescence affected Metrosideros arthropod communities. However, the pervasive positive influence of fertilisation did not translate to compositional shifts, and there were no interactions with leaf morphological class. In contrast, the effects of leaf pubescence on arthropod density, biomass, and diversity were more restricted taxonomically, and non-parametric manova and redundancy analyses demonstrated significant differentiation in community composition on the pubescent morphology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Gruner","given":"Daniel S."},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Andrew D."},{"family":"Forkner","given":"Rebecca E."}],"citation-key":"gruner.etal2005","container-title":"Ecological Entomology","DOI":"10.1111/j.0307-6946.2005.00710.x","ISSN":"1365-2311","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"language":"en","page":"428-443","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The effects of foliar pubescence and nutrient enrichment on arthropod communities of Metrosideros polymorpha (Myrtaceae)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0307-6946.2005.00710.x","volume":"30"},

It is thus essential to identify general macroecological patterns related to the distribution and functioning of soil organisms to support their conservation and consideration by governance.

Here we identify and characterize existing environmental gaps in soil taxa and ecosystem functioning data across soil macroecological studies and 17,186 sampling sites across the globe. These data gaps include important spatial, environmental, taxonomic, and functional gaps, and an almost complete absence of temporally explicit data. We also identify the limitations of soil macroecological studies to explore general patterns in soil biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, with only 0.3% of all sampling sites having both information about biodiversity and function, although with different taxonomic groups and functions at each site. Based on this information, we provide clear priorities to support and expand soil macroecological research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Guerra","given":"Carlos A."},{"family":"Heintz-Buschart","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Sikorski","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Chatzinotas","given":"Antonis"},{"family":"Guerrero-Ramírez","given":"Nathaly"},{"family":"Cesarz","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Beaumelle","given":"Léa"},{"family":"Rillig","given":"Matthias C."},{"family":"Maestre","given":"Fernando T."},{"family":"Delgado-Baquerizo","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Buscot","given":"François"},{"family":"Overmann","given":"Jörg"},{"family":"Patoine","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Helen R.

  {"id":"gunstone.etal2021","abstract":"Agricultural pesticide use and its associated environmental harms is widespread throughout much of the world. Efforts to mitigate this harm have largely been focused on reducing pesticide contamination of the water and air, as runoff and pesticide drift are the most signiﬁcant sources of offsite pesticide movement. Yet pesticide contamination of the soil can also result in environmental harm. Pesticides are often applied directly to soil as drenches and granules and increasingly in the form of seed coatings, making it important to understand how pesticides impact soil ecosystems. Soils contain an abundance of biologically diverse organisms that perform many important functions such as nutrient cycling, soil structure maintenance, carbon transformation, and the regulation of pests and diseases. Many terrestrial invertebrates have declined in recent decades. Habitat loss and agrichemical pollution due to agricultural intensiﬁcation have been identiﬁed as major driving factors. Here, we review nearly 400 studies on the effects of pesticides on non-target invertebrates that have egg, larval, or immature development in the soil. This review encompasses 275 unique species, taxa or combined taxa of soil organisms and 284 different pesticide active ingredients or unique mixtures of active ingredients. We identiﬁed and extracted relevant data in relation to the following endpoints: mortality, abundance, biomass, behavior, reproduction, biochemical biomarkers, growth, richness and diversity, and structural changes. This resulted in an analysis of over 2,800 separate “tested parameters,” measured as a change in a speciﬁc endpoint following exposure of a speciﬁc organism to a speciﬁc pesticide. We found that 70.5% of tested parameters showed negative effects, whereas 1.4% and 28.1% of tested parameters showed positive or no signiﬁcant effects from pesticide exposure, respectively. In addition, we discuss general effect trends among pesticide classes, taxa, and endpoints, as well as data gaps. Our review indicates that pesticides of all types pose a clear hazard to soil invertebrates. Negative effects are evident in both lab and ﬁeld studies, across all studied pesticide classes, and in a wide variety of soil organisms and endpoints. The prevalence of negative effects in our results underscores the need for soil organisms to be represented in any risk analysis of a pesticide that has the potential to contaminate soil, and for any signiﬁcant risk to be mitigated in a way that will speciﬁcally reduce harm to soil organisms and to the many important ecosystem services they provide.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Gunstone","given":"Tari"},{"family":"Cornelisse","given":"Tara"},{"family":"Klein","given":"Kendra"},{"family":"Dubey","given":"Aditi"},{"family":"Donley","given":"Nathan"}],"citation-key":"gunstone.etal2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Environmental Science","container-title-short":"Front.

Firstly, it improves the scientiﬁc quality of both disciplines through deeper insight on the study organisms and increased feasibility of the collected data. Secondly, it improves the prospects of the scientists involved and opens up potential funding sources, helping to solve the taxonomic impediment. Finally, improved collaboration could balance ecological research towards more species-rich, functionally important groups. This would increase the quality and effectiveness of nature conservation and management plans positively affecting the sustainability of environmental policy making.

Identifying the mechanisms underlying the effects of biodiversity on decomposition is critical given the rapid loss of species worldwide and the effects of this loss on human well-being. Yet despite comprehensive syntheses of studies on how biodiversity affects litter decomposition, key questions remain, including when, where and how biodiversity has a role and whether general patterns and mechanisms occur across ecosystems and different functional types of organism. Here, in field experiments across five terrestrial and aquatic locations, ranging from the subarctic to the tropics, we show that reducing the functional diversity of decomposer organisms and plant litter types slowed the cycling of litter carbon and nitrogen. Moreover, we found evidence of nitrogen transfer from the litter of nitrogen-fixing plants to that of rapidly decomposing plants, but not between other plant functional types, highlighting that specific interactions in litter mixtures control carbon and nitrogen cycling during decomposition. The emergence of this general mechanism and the coherence of patterns across contrasting terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems suggest that biodiversity loss has consistent consequences for litter decomposition and the cycling of major elements on broad spatial scales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Handa","given":"I.

  {"id":"hartemink2016","abstract":"The soil is defined differently by soil scientists, and its definition has changed over time. This paper reviews how the definition of the soil has changed since the early 1800s by selecting and listing 81 definitions given in a wide range of soil science books, handbooks, glossaries, and dictionaries. Initial definitions of the soil were based on developments in agricultural chemistry or geology. The soil was seen as a production factor (medium) for agriculture that needed to be understood before it could be improved, or the soil was defined as disintegrated rocks mixed with organic matter. Definitions were rudimentary reflecting the overall level of understanding. Soil variation was not well understood. Overarching soil definitions appeared in the late 1800s following some major shifts in the understanding and knowledge about soils. The definition of the soil was particularly relevant for soil survey and in soil classification because it affected how soils were viewed in the field and represented in a two dimensional way (soil maps). Both the World Reference Base (WRB) and Soil Taxonomy have defined the soil, but standard field books describing soils often lack a definition. Most of the definitions in dictionaries and glossaries are detailed stressing the organic and inorganic part of the soil as well the origin, complexity, and some of its functions. Current soil definitions have a more environmental outlook reflecting the broadening of the soil science discipline but definitions will change following scientific advances and discovery. Soils are defined differently by subdisciplines. Considerable research is conducted nowadays outside soil science departments and research centres, and for some researchers the soil may solely be a medium—just as it was in the mid-1800s. The effect of increased specialisation and expansion in soil science causes the detail of the investigation to prevail over the idea of soil as a complex dynamic system that is part of a much wider Earth system. This review ends with a proposal for a scientific definition of soil, and a definition for lay persons and the general public.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Hartemink","given":"A.

We thus investigated the organic matter (OM) biochemical composition of biostructures using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and its relationship with selected biological (respirometry) and chemical attributes. 2. We found significant differences in OM quality and potential respiration rate among biostructures. These results were attributed to production patterns of biostructures and invertebrate feeding behaviour. A multiple co-inertia analysis was performed with NIRS, respirometry and chemical results. It separated (i) carton termite mounds, (ii) earthworm casts and organo-mineral termite mounds and (iii) termite sheathings and ant deposits. 3. These results suggest that NIRS spectra might be used as 'fingerprints' to identify organisms responsible for soil aggregate production.

Increasing soil compaction was accompanied by a decrease in microbial biomass C and the density of collembola. The influence of soil compaction on microbial biomass C was smaller than that of the standing crop. However, for collembola, especially euedaphic species, a reduction in pore space appeared to be of more importance than the effects of a standing crop.

Many mechanisms have been tested by comparing the characteristics of native and alien species, but few studies have considered ecological strategies. Here we aim at comparing the competitive ability, stress tolerance, and ruderalism (CSR) of native and alien trees in the tropical rainforests of Réunion Island. A total of sixteen 100 m2 plots (eight ‘near-trail’ and eight ‘off-trail’, at less disturbed sites) were established over a 2100 m elevational gradient. Three traits were measured in 1093 leaves from 237 trees: leaf area, leaf dry matter content and speciﬁc leaf area. They were converted into a CSR score assigned to each of the 80 surveyed tree species (70 native and 10 alien) using the ‘Stratefy’ ordination approach. C scores increased with basal area and S scores with elevation, but R scores were not higher along the trail, thus only partially validating Stratefy. Native and alien trees had similar CS strategies, thus challenging invasion hypotheses predicting a difference in ecological strategies and rather demonstrating the importance of environmental ﬁltering. However, other differences falling outside the CSR theory may also explain the success of alien species on Réunion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Heymans","given":"Lyse"},{"family":"Meyer","given":"Jean-Yves"},{"family":"Ah-Peng","given":"Claudine"},{"family":"Ethève","given":"Quentin"},{"family":"Flores","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Lavergne","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Mallet","given":"Bertrand"},{"family":"Parlevliet","given":"Hilde"},{"family":"Strasberg","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Pouteau","given":"Robin"}],"citation-key":"heymans.etal2023","container-title":"Plants","container-title-short":"Plants","DOI":"10.3390/plants12233990","ISSN":"2223-7747","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,27]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"3990","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Do Native and Alien Species Differ in Their Ecological Strategies?

Further species loss will accelerate change in ecosystem processes, but it is unclear how these effects compare to the direct effects of other forms of environmental change that are both driving diversity loss and altering ecosystem function. Here we use a suite of meta-analyses of published data to show that the effects of species loss on productivity and decomposition--two processes important in all ecosystems--are of comparable magnitude to the effects of many other global environmental changes. In experiments, intermediate levels of species loss (21-40%) reduced plant production by 5-10%, comparable to previously documented effects of ultraviolet radiation and climate warming. Higher levels of extinction (41-60%) had effects rivalling those of ozone, acidification, elevated CO(2) and nutrient pollution. At intermediate levels, species loss generally had equal or greater effects on decomposition than did elevated CO(2) and nitrogen addition. The identity of species lost also had a large effect on changes in productivity and decomposition, generating a wide range of plausible outcomes for extinction. Despite the need for more studies on interactive effects of diversity loss and environmental changes, our analyses clearly show that the ecosystem consequences of local species loss are as quantitatively significant as the direct effects of several global change stressors that have mobilized major international concern and remediation efforts.","author":[{"family":"Hooper","given":"David U."},{"family":"Adair","given":"E.

Until now, no species from the family Neanuridae have been successfully reared. Here we use controlled growth experiments to provide explicit evidence that the species Neanura muscorum can be raised under laboratory conditions when its diet is supplemented with slime mould. Significant gains in growth were observed in Collembola given slime mould rather than a standard diet of algae-covered bark. These benefits are further highlighted by the reproductive success of the experimental group and persistence of laboratory breeding stocks of this species and others in the family. The necessity for slime mould in the diet is attributed to the ‘suctorial’ mouthpart morphology characteristic of the Neanuridae. Maintaining laboratory populations of neanurid Collembola species will facilitate their use as model organisms, paving the way for studies that will broaden the current understanding of the environmental physiology of arthropods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoskins","given":"Jessica L."},{"family":"Janion-Scheepers","given":"Charlene"},{"family":"Chown","given":"Steven L."},{"family":"Duffy","given":"Grant A."}],"citation-key":"hoskins.etal2015","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/srep11957","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",7,8]]},"language":"en","license":"2015 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"11957","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Growth and reproduction of laboratory-reared neanurid Collembola using a novel slime mould diet","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep11957","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"illig.etal2010","abstract":"Microarthropod communities in the soil and on the bark of trees were investigated along an elevation gradient (1,850, 2,000, 2,150, 2,300 m) in a tropical montane rain forest in southern Ecuador. We hypothesised that the density of microarthropods declines with depth in soil and increases with increasing altitude mainly due to the availability of resources, i.e. organic matter. In addition, we expected bark and soil communities to differ strongly, since the bark of trees is more exposed to harsher factors. In contrast to our hypothesis, the density of major microarthropod groups (Collembola, Oribatida, Gamasina, Uropodina) was generally low and decreased with altitude. However, as we predicted the density of each of the groups decreased with soil depth. Density of microarthropods on tree bark was lower than in soil. Overall, 43 species of oribatid mites were found, with the most abundant higher taxa being Poronota, pycnonotic Apheredermata, Mixonomata and Eupheredermata. The oribatid mite community on bark did not differ significantly from that in soil. The number of oribatid mite species declined with altitude (24, 23, 17 and 13 species at 1,850, 2,000, 2,150 and 2,300 m, respectively). Rarefaction curves indicate that overall about 50 oribatid mite species are to be expected along the studied altitudinal gradient. Results of this study indicate (1) that microarthropods may be limited by the quality of resources at high altitudes and by the amount of resources at deeper soil layers, and (2) that the bark of trees and the soil are habitats of similar quality for oribatid mites.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Illig","given":"Jens"},{"family":"Norton","given":"Roy A."},{"family":"Scheu","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Maraun","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"illig.etal2010","container-title":"Experimental and Applied Acarology","container-title-short":"Exp Appl Acarol","DOI":"10.1007/s10493-010-9348-x","ISSN":"1572-9702","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"49-62","source":"Springer Link","title":"Density and community structure of soil- and bark-dwelling microarthropods along an altitudinal gradient in a tropical montane rainforest","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10493-010-9348-x","volume":"52"},

The beneficial effect of springtails for plant health have been confirmed by several subsequent studies with different collembolan and fungal species. Collembola have been found to feed preferably on pathogenic rather than on antagonistic or arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal propagules, thus springtails can reduce the inoculum of pathogens without counteracting the activity of fungi beneficial for plant growth and health.

  {"id":"jagersopakkerhuis.etal1988","abstract":"In 1983 and 1984 an inventory was made of the edaphic mites and springtails in a six-year rotation, a three-year rotation and a three-year rotation in which the soil was disinfectedwith metamsodium after the potato crop was harvested. The aim was to find possible direct or indirect biological factors related to the yield loss observed in the three-year rotation potato crop. The test site was situated on a heavy marine clay soil. Samples were taken four times in the course of the growing season. The mesofauna was extracted by means of Macfadyen high-gradient extraction. The following depths were extracted: 0-2,5; 2.5-5; 7.5-10; 15-17.5 and 25-27. 5 cm. The results were examined by analytical and synthetical procedures. The mesofauna was much more abundant in cereals than in root and tuber crops. Most mites and springtails were found near the surface of the soil except in potato when it was preceded by a cereal crop that was plowed down. In 1983, a year with relatively heavy and prolonged rainfall, more mites were found in corresponding crops of the six-year rotation than of the three-year rotation. The short rotation reduced the abundance of Tectocepheus velatus, whereas the percentage of the Tullbergia krausbaueri group and the number of Heterostigmata were increased. In 1984, a year with colder and drier weather, more mites and springtails were found in the potato crop of the three-year rotation than in the potato crops of the six-year rotation. Correspondence analysis resulted in four axes that could be given a meaningful interpretation. Ordination of the samples and species along the first axis was mainly due to the presence of Tectocepheus velatus and was related with depth, rotation and climatic factors. The second axis showed a year-effect for the 1983 and 1984 potato crops. The species composition of the mesofauna in many ways reflected crop effects as shown by the ordination of the samples and species along axes 3 and 4. There was a suggestion of a possible contribution of the Acaridae to the yield loss. This has to be subjected to further study. The mesofauna was indicative of a low content of fresh decomposing organic matter and a compacted soil structure in the root and tuber crops. The high percentage (66%) of root and tuber crops is the most probable cause of the low abundance and species richness of the mesofauna in the three-year rotation. Lower yields in the three-year rotation potato crop coincided with the indication by the mesofauna of a more compact soil structure and less fresh decomposing organic matter, which was even more so in the disinfected three year rotation. Still, soil treatment with metamsodium partially reduced the yield depression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Jagers Op Akkerhuis","given":"Gerard"},{"family":"Ley","given":"F.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Zwetsloot","given":"Henk"},{"family":"Ponge","given":"Jean-François"},{"family":"Brussaard","given":"Lijbert"}],"citation-key":"jagersopakkerhuis.etal1988","container-title":"Revue d'Ecologie et de Biologie du Sol","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1988",4]]},"page":"175-202","source":"HAL Archives Ouvertes","title":"Soil microarthropods (Acari and Collembola) in two crop rotations on a heavy marine clay soil","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://hal.science/hal-00506978","volume":"25"},
  {"id":"janion-scheepers.etal2015","abstract":"Understanding the abundance and richness of species is one of the most fundamental steps in effecting their conservation. Despite global recognition of the significance of the below-ground component of diversity for ecosystem functioning, the soil remains a poorly studied terrestrial ecosystem. In South Africa, knowledge is increasing for a variety of soil faunal groups, but many still remain poorly understood. We have started to address this gap in the knowledge of South African soil biodiversity by focusing on the Collembola in an integrated project that encompasses systematics, barcoding and ecological assessments. Here we provide an updated list of the Collembola species from South Africa. A total of 124 species from 61 genera and 17 families has been recorded, of which 75 are considered endemic, 24 widespread, and 25 introduced. This total number of species excludes the 36 species we consider to be dubious. From the published data, Collembola species richness is high compared to other African countries, but low compared to European countries. This is largely a consequence of poor sampling in the African region, as our discovery of many new species in South Africa demonstrates. Our analyses also show that much ongoing work will be required before a reasonably comprehensive and spatially explicit picture of South Africa’s springtail fauna can be provided, which may well exceed 1000 species. Such work will be necessary to help South Africa meet its commitments to biodiversity conservation, especially in the context of the 2020 Aichi targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Janion-Scheepers","given":"Charlene"},{"family":"Deharveng","given":"Louis"},{"family":"Bedos","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Chown","given":"Steven L."}],"citation-key":"janion-scheepers.etal2015","container-title":"ZooKeys","container-title-short":"Zookeys","DOI":"10.3897/zookeys.503.8966","ISSN":"1313-2989","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",5,11]]},"page":"55-88","PMCID":"PMC4440272","PMID":"26019671","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Updated list of Collembola species currently recorded from South Africa","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4440272/","volume":"503"},

  {"id":"janion-scheepers.etal2016a","abstract":"Although fire is a natural form of disturbance in many ecosystems, the frequency of fires is increasing due to human activities. Hence, understanding the impacts of fire on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has become increasingly important. In this study we investigated the effects of a large-scale fire on an important soil-dwelling group, springtails (Collembola), one year before and for three consecutive years after a fire in the fire-prone fynbos ecosystem in South Africa. In particular, we investigate the resistance of the springtail assemblages (i.e. their ability to remain relatively unchanged in the face of a disturbance), and their resilience (i.e. ability to return to a pre-disturbance state). To do this we sampled two sites with contrasting vegetation (Erica and Protea) and used three different standardized litter types in litterbag traps. A total of 35 springtail species from 31 genera and 14 families was found. The springtail assemblages in this fynbos system showed slightly more resistance to fire than resilience after the fire event, though substantial variation was found among vegetation types. Mean species richness and abundance per litterbag varied among the Protea and Erica sites, with resistant species being dominant in the Erica site, while species that showed an increase after the fire were dominant in the Protea site. Differences were also found between life forms: atmobiotic (free-living in vegetation) and epiedaphic (surface dwelling) species showed a significant decline in mean species richness directly after the fire in the Erica site. Euedaphic (soil-dwelling) species richness remained unchanged post-fire in the Erica site, while actually slightly increasing after the fire in the Protea site. Although the fynbos springtail assemblages had not fully recovered to pre-fire abundance after three years, many species appear to be resistant to or recover rapidly after fires, at least as ascertained over the relatively short (four years) duration of the study. It is likely that this response is influenced by the presence of suitable refugia within sites and by species-specific traits. Given changing fire regimes and the increasing frequency of fires due to human disturbances, the system will likely become more dominated by resistant springtail species preferring nutrient rich circumstances and easily decomposed litters.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Janion-Scheepers","given":"Charlene"},{"family":"Bengtsson","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Leinaas","given":"Hans Petter"},{"family":"Deharveng","given":"Louis"},{"family":"Chown","given":"Steven L."}],"citation-key":"janion-scheepers.etal2016a","container-title":"Applied Soil Ecology","container-title-short":"Applied Soil Ecology","DOI":"10.1016/j.apsoil.2016.08.001","ISSN":"0929-1393","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"165-175","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The response of springtails to fire in the fynbos of the Western Cape, South Africa","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139316302165","volume":"108"},

We found that, from the tropics to the sub-Antarctic, alien species have the broadest thermal tolerances and greatest tolerance to environmental warming. Both groups of species show little phenotypic plasticity or potential for evolutionary change in tolerance to high temperature.

  {"id":"janion-scheepers.etal2020","abstract":"Aim The extraordinary diversity of plants across the Cape Floristic Region is characterized by considerable species turnover among sites. Phytophagous insects show similarly high turnover, but their patterns are closely coupled to those of their hosts. If the mechanisms underlying high plant turnover are not unique to plants, similar patterns of turnover should also be seen in non-herbivorous arthropod groups. We tested this hypothesis using new data for the Collembola fauna of the Fynbos biome. Location The south-western Cape, South Africa. Taxon Springtails (Hexapoda: Collembola). Methods We sampled springtails from six sites over two seasons. Species richness was compared with expected values from other studies worldwide given the environmental characteristics of the sites sampled. Nestedness and turnover components of beta diversity were calculated and compared against beta diversity patterns of springtails across Europe. Results A total of 114 morphospecies from 14 families was collected. Species richness of Fynbos sites ranged from 14 to 31 species, which was not significantly different to that previously reported for non-Fynbos locations and generally within expectations given the temperature, rainfall and productive energy of each site. Beta diversity was high across all pairwise comparisons of Fynbos sites and dominated by species replacement rather than assemblage nestedness. Relative to the distance between sites, Fynbos assemblages, with a median inter-site distance of 140 km, showed beta diversity substantially higher than in European assemblages, which had a median inter-site distance of 1,270 km. Main conclusions Alpha diversity of Fynbos Collembola assemblages is in keeping with species richness expectations. By contrast, beta diversity is high given the small distances among sites and is characterized predominantly by species turnover. These patterns of unremarkable alpha diversity, but high turnover among sites are comparable to many Fynbos plant groups. The mechanisms giving rise to high beta diversity of the plants may also have led to high diversity in other taxa.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Janion-Scheepers","given":"Charlene"},{"family":"Bengtsson","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Duffy","given":"Grant A."},{"family":"Deharveng","given":"Louis"},{"family":"Leinaas","given":"Hans Petter"},{"family":"Chown","given":"Steven L."}],"citation-key":"janion-scheepers.etal2020","container-title":"Journal of Biogeography","DOI":"10.1111/jbi.13801","ISSN":"1365-2699","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","page":"1007-1018","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"High spatial turnover in springtails of the Cape Floristic Region","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jbi.13801","volume":"47"},

Their installation is also perceived as a possible way to preserve biodiversity in cities. However, the effectiveness of green roofs in supporting biodiversity, especially soil biodiversity, has rarely been studied. In order to orient the ecological engineering of green roofs, it is crucial to understand the resulting biodiversity patterns. We hypothesised that a functional trait-based approach could be used to investigate different ways of colonisation. We investigated collembolan communities in both extensive and productive green roofs. Surprisingly, no difference was observed in either taxonomic or functional structures of collembolan diversity between extensive and productive green roofs. Conversely, according to the functional composition, two ways of colonisation are suggested: a passive wind dispersal − the “flying” collembolans − and a settlement through compost inputs. We conclude that stakeholders should take into account the spatial connections of green roofs with other green spaces in order to support soil biodiversity. Further studies are needed to more accurately elucidate the importance of green roof types for collembolan communities and associated ecological networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Joimel","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Grard","given":"Baptiste"},{"family":"Auclerc","given":"Apolline"},{"family":"Hedde","given":"Mickaël"},{"family":"Le Doaré","given":"Nolwenn"},{"family":"Salmon","given":"Sandrine"},{"family":"Chenu","given":"Claire"}],"citation-key":"joimel.etal2018","container-title":"Ecological Engineering","container-title-short":"Ecological Engineering","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.12.002","ISSN":"0925-8574","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,1]]},"page":"117-124","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Are Collembola “flying” onto green roofs?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857417306353","volume":"111"},

Microcosms were incubated for 16 weeks with ﬁne and coarse litterbags in soils from three types of management systems: fallow, integrated farming and organic farming, the latter two cropped with wheat. The effects were studied by analysing litter mass loss, C and N content, DOC, nitrate and pH in soil leachate, and CO2 production, as well as mesofauna. Mesofauna signiﬁcantly accelerated mass loss and C and N release from clover litter in all three soils. With mesofauna access, at the end of the experiment average clover mass loss was almost twice as high and clover C and N content were 60% lower than without mesofauna. Farming systems inﬂuenced the decomposition through affecting both element turnover and mesofauna. Although in the ﬁrst weeks less N was leached from organic farming than from integrated farming soil, cumulative N leaching did not differ between these soils. However, more than 20% less N was leached from the fallow soil than from the ﬁeld soils. CO2 production was highest in fallow soil. Here, mesofauna had no effect on this variable. In soil with integrated farming, mesofauna reduced cumulative CO2 production by 10% whereas in soil from organic farming it increased CO2 production by 20%.

  {"id":"kelly.samways2003","abstract":"Cousine Island, Seychelles, is of major conservation significance as it is in a biodiversity hotspot. Furthermore, it is relatively pristine, and is apparently the only tropical island over 20 ha with no alien invasive mammals. This study focuses on the island's log and litter arthropods, which were sampled by extraction methods from the dominant species, Pisonia grandis, Ficus spp. and Cocos nucifera. Stage of decomposition, and forest type in which the logs occurred, both significantly influenced the composition and structure of the arthropod assemblages. Young logs were significantly richer in species than older logs, possibly because they had the most resources and microhabitats. There were some significant changes in arthropod species richness, composition and abundance between species of young logs, but not old ones, because as logs decomposed, arthropod assemblages converged. Nevertheless, each old log species had some arthropod species not present in other log species, which has important implications for conservation. Arthropod assemblages in woody litter varied according to the forest type in which they occurred, and were different from those in logs in the same forest type. Cousine Island arthropod species richness, both in logs and litter, was comparable to figures from other tropical areas. As the logs, especially P. grandis, are home to many Seychelles endemic species, their conservation is essential. Furthermore, as the arthropods are also the main food of certain threatened Seychelles vertebrates, their conservation also underpins a food chain on this unique tropical island.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Kelly","given":"Janine A."},{"family":"Samways","given":"Michael J."}],"citation-key":"kelly.samways2003","container-title":"Biodiversity & Conservation","container-title-short":"Biodiversity and Conservation","DOI":"10.1023/A:1024161722449","ISSN":"1572-9710","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1793-1813","source":"Springer Link","title":"Diversity and conservation of forest-floor arthropods on a small Seychelles island","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1024161722449","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"kemp.etal2019","abstract":"As most plants rely on pollination for persistence in communities, pollination interactions should be important determinants of plant community assembly. Here, trait and phylogenetic null modelling approaches were combined with pollinator interaction networks to elucidate the processes structuring flower colour assembly patterns in Asteraceae communities in Namaqualand, South Africa.Plant species were assigned to flower colour pattern categories (CPCs) that incorporate the complexity of the bulls-eye colour pattern, using pollinator vision models. Null models were used to assess whether daisy communities exhibit clustering (driven by filtering, facilitation or convergence) or overdispersion (driven by competitive exclusion or character displacement) of CPCs. Next, flower visitor networks were constructed for communities with non-random CPC assembly to confirm the functional role of pollinators in determining floral trait assembly.Plant species are unevenly distributed across CPCs, the majority of which are not phylogenetically conserved, suggesting that certain CPCs have a selective advantage. Clustering of CPCs in communities is more frequent than overdispersion, and this does not reflect non-random phylogenetic assembly. In most communities at least one CPC is overrepresented relative to null assemblages. Interaction networks show that each community has a single dominant pollinator that strongly interacts with the overrepresented CPC, suggesting a role for pollinator preferences in driving clustered assembly of CPCs within daisy communities.This novel approach, which demonstrates non-random assembly of complex flower colour patterns and corroborates their functional association with particular pollinators, provides strong evidence that pollinators influence plant community assembly. Results suggest that in some community contexts the benefits of pollinator sharing outweigh the costs of heterospecific pollen transfer, generating clustered assembly. They also challenge the perception of generalized pollination in daisies, suggesting instead that complex daisy colour patterns represent a pollination syndrome trait linked to specific fly pollinators.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Kemp","given":"Jurene E"},{"family":"Bergh","given":"Nicola G"},{"family":"Soares","given":"Muri"},{"family":"Ellis","given":"Allan G"}],"citation-key":"kemp.etal2019","container-title":"Annals of Botany","container-title-short":"Annals of Botany","DOI":"10.1093/aob/mcy126","ISSN":"0305-7364","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,23]]},"page":"277-288","source":"Silverchair","title":"Dominant pollinators drive non-random community assembly and shared flower colour patterns in daisy communities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcy126","volume":"123"},

Population size may be one such factor, with larger populations thought to be able to support more complex cultural traits. This hypothesis has been suggested by mathematical models and empirical studies of small-scale societies. However, to date there have been few experimental demonstrations of an effect of population size on cultural accumulation. Here we provide such a demonstration using a novel task, solving jigsaw puzzles. 80 participants divided into ten transmission chains solved puzzles in one of two conditions: one in which participants had access to one semi-completed puzzle from the previous generation, and the other in which participants simultaneously saw three semi-completed puzzles from the previous generation. As predicted, the mean number of pieces solved increased over time in the three-puzzle-per-generation condition, but not in the one-puzzle-per-generation condition. Thus, our experiment provides support for a hypothesized relationship between population size and cultural accumulation. In particular, our results suggest that the ability to simultaneously learn from multiple cultural models, and combine the knowledge of those multiple models, is most likely to allow larger groups to support more complex culture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Kempe","given":"Marius"},{"family":"Mesoudi","given":"Alex"}],"citation-key":"kempe.mesoudi2014","container-title":"Evolution and Human Behavior","container-title-short":"Evolution and Human Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2014.02.009","ISSN":"10905138","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",7]]},"language":"en","page":"285-290","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"An experimental demonstration of the effect of group size on cultural accumulation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1090513814000294","volume":"35"},

When compared to mainland areas, oceanic islands in general are known for their high percentage of endemic species but only moderate levels of species richness, prompting the question of their relative conservation value. Here we quantify geographic patterns of endemism-scaled richness (“endemism richness”) of vascular plants across 90 terrestrial biogeographic regions, including islands, worldwide and evaluate their congruence with terrestrial vertebrates. Endemism richness of plants and vertebrates is strongly related, and values on islands exceed those of mainland regions by a factor of 9.5 and 8.1 for plants and vertebrates, respectively. Comparisons of different measures of past and future human impact and land cover change further reveal marked differences between mainland and island regions. While island and mainland regions suffered equally from past habitat loss, we find the human impact index, a measure of current threat, to be significantly higher on islands. Projected land-cover changes for the year 2100 indicate that land-use-driven changes on islands might strongly increase in the future. Given their conservation risks, smaller land areas, and high levels of endemism richness, islands may offer particularly high returns for species conservation efforts and therefore warrant a high priority in global biodiversity conservation in this century.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Kier","given":"Gerold"},{"family":"Kreft","given":"Holger"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Tien Ming"},{"family":"Jetz","given":"Walter"},{"family":"Ibisch","given":"Pierre L."},{"family":"Nowicki","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Mutke","given":"Jens"},{"family":"Barthlott","given":"Wilhelm"}],"citation-key":"kier.etal2009","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0810306106","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",6,9]]},"page":"9322-9327","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"pnas.org (Atypon)","title":"A global assessment of endemism and species richness across island and mainland regions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0810306106","volume":"106"},

Less well understood is the extent to which patterns of host use vary within or among related species, largely because of the technical difficulties associated with quantifying this. Here we develop a recently characterized molecular approach to quantify diet within and between two closely related species of weevil occurring primarily within dry forests on the island of Mauritius. Our aim is to quantify dietary variation across populations and assess adaptive and nonadaptive explanations for this and to characterize the nature of a trophic shift within an ecologically distinct population within one of the species. We find that our study species are polyphagous, consuming a much wider range of plants than would be suggested by the literature. Our data suggest that local diet variation is largely explained by food availability, and locally specialist populations consume food plants that are not phylogenetically novel, but do appear to represent a novel preference. Our results demonstrate the power of molecular methods to unambiguously quantify dietary variation across populations of insect herbivores, providing a valuable approach to understanding trophic interactions within and among local plant and insect herbivore communities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Kitson","given":"James J.

  {"id":"kitson.etal2018","abstract":"Aim To test a prediction derived from island biogeographical theory that in situ speciation should make an increasingly important contribution to community assembly as islands age. This prediction is tested on estimated biogeographical histories from Mauritius (approximately 9 Myr) and Reunion (approximately 5 Myr). We additionally investigate the evolutionary dynamics of insect flight loss, as the loss of flight in island lineages can influence patterns of diversification. Location Mascarene Islands; Southwest Indian Ocean. Taxon Weevils. Methods Up to five individuals of each taxonomically described species sampled within each sampling site were sequenced for the mitochondrial gene Cytochrome Oxidase II to delimit operational taxonomic units (OTUs). OTUs were further sequenced for the nuclear genes Arginine Kinase, Histone 3 and ribosomal 28s, to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of the group. Timings of colonization and in situ speciation events were estimated with beast2. Results Our results support the hypothesis that present-day species richness on the older island of Mauritius is largely the result of in situ speciation, with few colonization events, of which all but the most basal are recent. In contrast, Reunion presents a more uniform temporal spectrum of colonization times. Flight loss has evolved convergently at least five times, and speciation events associated with flight loss are significantly younger than speciation events that have not resulted in flight loss. Main conclusions Patterns of community assembly on the islands of Mauritius and Reunion fit a model where the addition of new species and species turnover is increasingly dominated by in situ speciation as an island community matures. Repeated flight loss indicates selection for flightlessness, with the young age of flightless lineages suggesting higher extinction rates over longer evolutionary time-scales and little influence on present-day species richness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Kitson","given":"James J.

  {"id":"klarner.etal2014","abstract":"Anthropogenic land use shapes the dynamics and composition of central European forests and changes the quality and availability of resources of the decomposer system. These changes likely alter the structure and functioning of soil animal food webs. Using stable isotope analysis (13C, 15N) we investigated the trophic position and resource use of soil animal species in each of four forest types (coniferous, young managed beech, old managed beech and unmanaged beech forests) across three regions in Germany. Twenty-eight species of soil invertebrates were analyzed covering three consumer levels and a representative spectrum of feeding types and morphologies. Data on stable isotope signatures of leaf litter, fine roots and soil were included to evaluate to which extent signatures of soil animals vary with those of local resources. Soil animal δ15N and δ13C signatures varied with the respective signatures of leaf litter and fine roots. After calibration to leaf litter signatures, soil animal stable isotope signatures of the different beech forests did not differ significantly. However, thick leaf litter layers, such as those in coniferous forests, were associated with low animal stable isotope signatures presumably due to reduced access of decomposer animals to root-derived resources, suggesting that the decomposer food web is shifted towards leaf litter based energy pathways with the shift affecting all consumer levels. Variation in stable isotope signatures of soil animal species with litter quality parameters suggests that nutrition of third level but not first and second level consumers is related to litter quality, potentially due to microorganisms locking up litter resources thereby hampering their propagation to higher trophic levels.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Klarner","given":"Bernhard"},{"family":"Ehnes","given":"Roswitha B."},{"family":"Erdmann","given":"Georgia"},{"family":"Eitzinger","given":"Bernhard"},{"family":"Pollierer","given":"Melanie M."},{"family":"Maraun","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Scheu","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"klarner.etal2014","container-title":"Oikos","DOI":"10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00939.x","ISSN":"1600-0706","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","page":"1173-1181","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Trophic shift of soil animal species with forest type as indicated by stable isotope analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00939.x","volume":"123"},
  {"id":"koh.etal2002","abstract":"Aim The primary objective of our study was to examine the factors affecting the distribution of vascular plants, springtails, butterflies and birds on small tropical islands to understand how different groups of organisms with distinct biological traits respond to biogeographical variables, such as island area. Location The Republic of Singapore (103°50′E, 1°20′N) located at the southern tip of Peninsular Malaysia. Methods Seventeen islands were surveyed for vascular plants, springtails, butterflies and birds. Correlation analysis, simple linear and multiple regression analyses and the nestedness index were used to test the hypotheses that (1) area is the best predictor of species/genus richness at both the community and specific/generic levels; (2) there is no correlation between population density and island area; and (3) species/genera are distributed as nested subsets. Results Area was the most significant factor in determining the island distribution of springtails, butterflies and birds at both the community and specific/generic levels, although there were disparate responses to the biogeographical variables between the three taxonomic groups, as well as between common species within each group. Individual species displayed disparate responses to biogeographical variables, suggesting that patterns of distribution at the community level may not be a good indicator of the population dynamics of individual species/genera. Plant species richness did not show any correlation with any of the tested variables. Population densities of springtails, butterflies and birds were positively correlated with area, contradicting the assumption of the equilibrium theory of island biogeography that population density of island species is independent of area. Population densities of plants showed no correlation with any of the tested biogeographical variables. Vascular plant, springtail, butterfly and bird communities on the islands showed significant patterns of nestedness, indicating there may be species/genus-specific responses to biogeographical variables. Main conclusions We conclude that although area was the most important factor affecting the island distribution of springtails, butterflies and birds, conservation planning must take into consideration how target taxonomic groups respond to biogeographical variables, instead of relying on general principles (e.g. those derived from the equilibrium theory). On a local scale, in order to preserve the island biodiversity of Singapore, the highest priority should be given to preserving the larger islands (e.g. Pulau Ubin) which not only have higher numbers of species, but also species that are absent on smaller islands.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Koh","given":"Lian Pin"},{"family":"Sodhi","given":"Navjot S."},{"family":"Tan","given":"Hugh Tiang Wah"},{"family":"Peh","given":"Kelvin S.-H."}],"citation-key":"koh.etal2002","container-title":"Journal of Biogeography","DOI":"10.1046/j.1365-2699.2002.00657.x","ISSN":"1365-2699","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]},"language":"en","page":"93-108","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Factors affecting the distribution of vascular plants, springtails, butterflies and birds on small tropical islands","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2699.2002.00657.x","volume":"29"},

Significantly fewer individuals and species were captured in smaller forest patches (<6 ha) for most of the taxa, except Formicidae, where a higher number of species were captured in medium-sized patches (7–9 ha). When sampling effort was standardized, a higher diversity (rarefaction and Simpson's diversity index) was obtained in the smaller patches for Carabidae, Staphylinidae and Formicidae. The only significant positive correlation between taxa, in terms of numbers of species, was between Carabidae and Staphylinidae. The other taxa showed only weak positive correlations between species richness, or negative correlations. Multivariate techniques showed significant species turnover between patch assemblages for each taxon, and also showed that some taxa are more similar in assemblage-structure than others. An index of complementarity showed that species compositions of the selected taxa varied greatly between forest patches of different sizes.

  {"id":"kotze.samways1999a","abstract":"Diversity patterns of amphipods, carabid beetles and ants were investigated in five naturally-fragmented Afromontane forest remnants, and in the surrounding grassland matrix. Forests were architecturally similar. In contrast, grasslands surrounding these forests are subject to great differences in anthropogenic impacts. Consequently, transition from forest to grassland ranged from being abrupt (heavy disturbance) to gradual (little disturbance). Significantly different mean numbers of carabid individuals and species were captured between sites and multivariate analyses showed clear separation in carabid assemblage-structure with level of disturbance. Carabids were, furthermore, significantly more diverse in forests, compared to grasslands. Ants, however, were equally species rich between sites but were significantly more abundant and species rich in grasslands than forests. Amphipods, represented here by a single species, Talistroides africana, was significantly less abundant at highly disturbed sites and significantly more abundant in forests than grasslands. Results support the hypothesis that the dynamics of remnants are influenced by their surrounding landscape. Here, the dynamics of amphipods and carabids (predominantly forest taxa) were influenced by different disturbance regimes in grasslands surrounding these forests. Epigaeic ants, a predominantly grassland taxon here, also showed significant differences in assemblage-composition between sites with varying disturbance.

  {"id":"kurzrock.etal2019","abstract":"Abstract. Numerical weather prediction models tend to underestimate cloud presence and therefore often overestimate global horizontal irradiance (GHI). The assimilation of cloud water path (CWP) retrievals from geostationary satellites using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) led to improved short-term GHI forecasts of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in midlatitudes in case studies. An evaluation of the method under tropical conditions and a quantification of this improvement for study periods of more than a few days are still missing. This paper focuses on the assimilation of CWP retrievals in three phases (ice, supercooled, and liquid) in a 6-hourly cycling procedure and on the impact of this method on short-term forecasts of GHI for Réunion Island, a tropical island in the southwest Indian Ocean. The multilayer gridded cloud properties of NASA Langley's Satellite ClOud and Radiation Property retrieval System (SatCORPS) are assimilated using the EnKF of the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) Manhattan release (revision 12002) and the advanced research WRF (ARW) v3.9.1.1. The ability of the method to improve cloud analyses and GHI forecasts is demonstrated, and a comparison using independent radiosoundings shows a reduction of specific humidity bias in the WRF analyses, especially in the low and middle troposphere. Ground-based GHI observations at 12 sites on Réunion Island are used to quantify the impact of CWP DA. Over a total of 44 d during austral summertime, when averaged over all sites, CWP data assimilation has a positive impact on GHI forecasts for all lead times between 5 and 14 h. Root mean square error and mean absolute error are reduced by 4 % and 3 %, respectively.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Kurzrock","given":"Frederik"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Hannah"},{"family":"Sauer","given":"Jerome"},{"family":"Chane Ming","given":"Fabrice"},{"family":"Cros","given":"Sylvain"},{"family":"Smith Jr.","given":"William L."},{"family":"Minnis","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Palikonda","given":"Rabindra"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Thomas A."},{"family":"Lallemand","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Linguet","given":"Laurent"},{"family":"Lajoie","given":"Gilles"}],"citation-key":"kurzrock.etal2019","container-title":"Geoscientific Model Development","container-title-short":"Geosci.

This bias is consistent with a simple mechanism of overproduction and selective attrition. Finally, we estimate that syllable types could frequently persist for more than 500 years. Our results demonstrate conformist bias in natural animal behaviour and show that this, along with moderately precise learning, may support traditions whose stability rivals those of humans.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Lachlan","given":"Robert F."},{"family":"Ratmann","given":"Oliver"},{"family":"Nowicki","given":"Stephen"}],"citation-key":"lachlan.etal2018","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-018-04728-1","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,20]]},"language":"en","page":"2417","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Cultural conformity generates extremely stable traditions in bird song","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04728-1","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"laland.etal2015","abstract":"Scientific activities take place within the structured sets of ideas and assumptions that define a field and its practices. The conceptual framework of evolutionary biology emerged with the Modern Synthesis in the early twentieth century and has since expanded into a highly successful research program to explore the processes of diversification and adaptation. Nonetheless, the ability of that framework satisfactorily to accommodate the rapid advances in developmental biology, genomics and ecology has been questioned. We review some of these arguments, focusing on literatures (evo-devo, developmental plasticity, inclusive inheritance and niche construction) whose implications for evolution can be interpreted in two ways—one that preserves the internal structure of contemporary evolutionary theory and one that points towards an alternative conceptual framework. The latter, which we label the ‘extended evolutionary synthesis' (EES), retains the fundaments of evolutionary theory, but differs in its emphasis on the role of constructive processes in development and evolution, and reciprocal portrayals of causation. In the EES, developmental processes, operating through developmental bias, inclusive inheritance and niche construction, share responsibility for the direction and rate of evolution, the origin of character variation and organism–environment complementarity. We spell out the structure, core assumptions and novel predictions of the EES, and show how it can be deployed to stimulate and advance research in those fields that study or use evolutionary biology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Laland","given":"Kevin N."},{"family":"Uller","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Feldman","given":"Marcus W."},{"family":"Sterelny","given":"Kim"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Gerd B."},{"family":"Moczek","given":"Armin"},{"family":"Jablonka","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Odling-Smee","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"laland.etal2015","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"legros.etal2016","abstract":"This first general inventory of Reunion’s terrestrial Heteroptera was built in two steps. First, current knowledge was assessed and 108 species were reported as present in Reunion. Secondly, a morpho-species based identification method allowed the compilation of an overview of the actual diversity of the terrestrial Heteroptera fauna on Reunion including undescribed species and an estimate of the proportion in the different families. Over a period of eight years this method allowed a general approach at a community level over most of the island. Sampling took into account the large diversity of Reunion’s vegetation and unique habitats. The analysis found 144 morpho-species and 15 species, and new identifications of one suborder, one family, two subfamilies, four tribes and 10 genera indicating a minimum of 18 new species. Based on current knowledge and the new identified taxa, a minimum of 126 species in 25 families are present on Reunion.

  {"id":"legros.etal2020","abstract":"A major part of La Réunion Island has been included on the World Heritage List of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for its unique landscapes and its outstanding biodiversity. However, there is a lack of knowledge on the arthropod diversity. For this reason, an up-to-date census of Réunion’s terrestrial arthropods was undertaken. Of the 3369 species that are reported from Réunion, 31% are endemic to the island and 40% are endemic to the Mascarenes. A diversity ratio between the numbers of described and expected species in the world was established and then applied to the numbers of reported species in Réunion to estimate the total expected numbers of species on the island. The results predict that between 6751 and 10,812 species of terrestrial arthropods are present in Réunion and that 62% of species remain to be discovered. However, some groups appear underrepresented as expected for Darwinian islands that should be originally composed by species with abilities to colonize remote places. Considering the global biodiversity decline and the numerous threats on Réunion’s natural habitats, this article emphasizes the crucial need for conservation of terrestrial arthropods and strongly encourages an increase in the list of protected arthropods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Legros","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Rochat","given":"Jacques"},{"family":"Reynaud","given":"Bernard"},{"family":"Strasberg","given":"Dominique"}],"citation-key":"legros.etal2020","container-title":"Journal of Insect Conservation","container-title-short":"J Insect Conserv","DOI":"10.1007/s10841-019-00188-0","ISSN":"1572-9753","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"199-217","source":"Springer Link","title":"Known and unknown terrestrial arthropod fauna of La Réunion Island, Indian Ocean","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10841-019-00188-0","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"leibold.etal2019","abstract":"Biodiversity in natural systems can be maintained either because niche differentiation among competitors facilitates stable coexistence or because equal fitness among neutral species allows for their long-term cooccurrence despite a slow drift toward extinction. Whereas the relative importance of these two ecological mechanisms has been well-studied in the absence of evolution, the role of local adaptive evolution in maintaining biological diversity through these processes is less clear. Here we study the contribution of local adaptive evolution to coexistence in a landscape of interconnected patches subject to disturbance. Under these conditions, early colonists to empty patches may adapt to local conditions sufficiently fast to prevent successful colonization by other preadapted species. Over the long term, the iteration of these local-scale priority effects results in niche convergence of species at the regional scale even though species tend to monopolize local patches. Thus, the dynamics evolve from stable coexistence through niche differentiation to neutral cooccurrence at the landscape level while still maintaining strong local niche segregation. Our results show that neutrality can emerge at the regional scale from local, niche-based adaptive evolution, potentially resolving why ecologists often observe neutral distribution patterns at the landscape level despite strong niche divergence among local communities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Leibold","given":"Mathew A."},{"family":"Urban","given":"Mark C."},{"family":"De Meester","given":"Luc"},{"family":"Klausmeier","given":"Christopher A."},{"family":"Vanoverbeke","given":"Joost"}],"citation-key":"leibold.etal2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1808615116","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,12]]},"language":"en","page":"2612-2617","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Regional neutrality evolves through local adaptive niche evolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1808615116","volume":"116"},
  {"id":"leinaas.etal2015","abstract":"Biological invasions are major threats to biodiversity, with impacts that may be compounded by other forms of environmental change. Observations of high density of the invasive springtail (Collembola), Hypogastrura manubrialis in heavily grazed renosterveld vegetation in the Western Cape, South Africa, raised the question of whether the invasion was favored by changes in plant litter quality associated with habitat disturbance in this vegetation type. To examine the likely mechanisms underlying the high abundance of H. manubrialis, cages with three types of naturally occurring litter with different nutrient content were placed out in the area and collected after different periods of time. Hypogastrura manubrialis was mainly found in the nutrient-rich litter of the yellowbush (Galenia africana), which responds positively to disturbance in the form of overgrazing. This suggests that invasion may have been facilitated by a positive interaction with this grazing resistant plant. By contrast, indigenous Collembola were least abundant in yellowbush litter. Negative correlations between high abundance of H. manubrialis and the abundance and diversity of other species suggest that competitive interactions might underlie low abundance of these other species at the patch level. Group behavior enables H. manubrialis to utilize efﬁciently this ephemeral, high quality resource, and might improve its competitive ability. The results suggest that interactions among environmental change drivers may lead to unforeseen invasion effects. H. manubrialis is not likely to be very successful in un-grazed renosterveld, but in combination with grazing, favoring the nutrient-rich yellowbush, it may become highly invasive. Field manipulations are required to fully verify these conclusions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Leinaas","given":"Hans Petter"},{"family":"Bengtsson","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Janion‐Scheepers","given":"Charlene"},{"family":"Chown","given":"Steven L."}],"citation-key":"leinaas.etal2015","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.1483","ISSN":"2045-7758, 2045-7758","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",8]]},"language":"en","page":"3462-3471","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Indirect effects of habitat disturbance on invasion: nutritious litter from a grazing resistant plant favors alien over native Collembola","title-short":"Indirect effects of habitat disturbance on invasion","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.1483","volume":"5"},

In addition, soil food web indices and metabolic footprints, which can be targeted in enhancement of soil suppressiveness against plant-parasitic nematodes, were also evaluated. Nematode genera from soil samples collected from the monocrop and intercrop fields were identified. The two cropping systems cumulatively had 24 nematode genera belonging to ten functional guilds. Mung bean monocrop had a significantly high number of Scutellonema and Prismatolaimus while the intercrop fields had a greater population of Meloidogyne. There were no significant differences in indices between intercrop and monocrop fields. In both systems, the maturity index of nematodes in cp 2–5 was 2.52 and the channel, basal and enrichment indices were below 50%. Metabolic footprints were similar except the composite footprint which was significantly higher in the maize-mung bean intercrop. Scutellonema and Acrobeles were positively associated with pH while Aphelenchus was positively associated with Carbon.

Despite extensive work, the relationships between major collembolan lineages are still debated and, apart from the Early Devonian fossil Rhyniella praecursor, which demonstrates their antiquity, the time frame of springtail evolution is unknown. In this study, we sequence two new mitochondrial genomes and reanalyze all known Collembola mt-genomes, including selected metagenomic data, to produce an improved phylogenetic hypothesis for the group, develop a tentative time frame for their differentiation, and provide a comprehensive overview of gene order diversity. Our analyses support most taxonomically recognized entities. We find support for an Entomobryomorpha + Symphypleona clade, while the position of Neelipleona could not be assessed with confidence. A Silurian time frame for their basal diversification is recovered, with an indication that divergence times may be fairly old overall. The distribution of mitochondrial gene order indicates the pancrustacean arrangement as plesiomorphic and dominant in the group, with the exception of the family Onychiuridae. We distinguished multiple instances of different arrangements in individual genomes or small clusters. We further discuss the opportunities and drawbacks associated with the inclusion of metagenomic data in a classic study on mitochondrial genome diversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Leo","given":"Chiara"},{"family":"Carapelli","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Cicconardi","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Frati","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Nardi","given":"Francesco"}],"citation-key":"leo.etal2019","container-title":"Diversity","DOI":"10.3390/d11090169","ISSN":"1424-2818","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",9]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"9","page":"169","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Mitochondrial Genome Diversity in Collembola: Phylogeny, Dating and Gene Order","title-short":"Mitochondrial Genome Diversity in Collembola","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-2818/11/9/169","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"levin1992","abstract":"It is argued that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an \"observer\" of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study ofecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range ofscales will have unique causes and biological consequences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Levin","given":"Simon A."}],"citation-key":"levin1992","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.2307/1941447","ISSN":"00129658","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1992",12]]},"language":"en","page":"1943-1967","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Problem of Pattern and Scale in Ecology: The Robert H.

  {"id":"li.etal2020","abstract":"As the dynamics and magnitude of rhizodeposition vary considerably among cropping systems, we investigated effects of cropping system on the incorporation of root-derived carbon (C) into Collembola, a dominant taxon of soil microarthropods. In the field, we used 13CO2 to pulse label a crop monoculture (oilseed rape, Brassica napus L.), a mixed-grass community (dominated by Lolium perenne L. mixed with clover Trifolium repens L.), and a tree plantation (willow, Salix schwerinii E.L. Wolf and Salix viminalis L.). During 28 days, the incorporation of 13C was traced in nine species of Collembola including epedaphic (surface-dwelling), hemiedaphic (litter-dwelling), and euedaphic (soil-dwelling) functional groups. Incorporation of 13C into Collembola reached a plateau before day 3 after the labeling in grass and willow, but increased up to day 14 in rape. While euedaphic Collembola incorporated less root-derived C than epedaphic and hemiedaphic Collembola in rape and willow, the incorporation of 13C was similar among functional groups in grass. Differential incorporation of 13C in euedaphic species points to niche differentiation within the same functional group. Our findings highlight that cropping system not only affects the flux of root C into soil mesofauna, being slower in rape than in grass and willow, but also the utilization of root-derived resources by functional groups and species of Collembola. The results indicate that pronounced differences in belowground C inputs between cropping systems affect microbivores as basal species and thereby soil food webs and their functioning and services.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Zhipeng"},{"family":"Scheunemann","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Potapov","given":"Anton M."},{"family":"Shi","given":"Lingling"},{"family":"Pausch","given":"Johanna"},{"family":"Scheu","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Pollierer","given":"Melanie M."}],"citation-key":"li.etal2020","container-title":"Biology and Fertility of Soils","container-title-short":"Biol Fertil Soils","DOI":"10.1007/s00374-020-01467-8","ISSN":"1432-0789","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"839-851","source":"Springer Link","title":"Incorporation of root-derived carbon into soil microarthropods varies between cropping systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00374-020-01467-8","volume":"56"},

However, due to the complexity of detrital food webs, no consistent pattern of cascading effects has emerged. Furthermore, global changes, such as increased nitrogen (N) deposition, likely have significant impacts on detrital trophic interactions but are not well understood. Here, we evaluate how increased N deposition influences trophic cascades using a simplified detrital food web (spider–Collembola) that has previously exhibited trophic cascades in an experimental context. We tested the impact of N addition on the direct and cascading effects of spiders in detritus food web. We manipulated the abundance of spiders with sit-and-wait or actively hunting foraging strategies in microcosms. Under ambient N conditions (control treatments), we did not detect trophic cascade effects of spiders on litter decomposition. In contrast, N addition enhanced the negative trophic cascade effects of spiders on decomposition by directly reducing Collembola density. Our findings suggest that understanding how increased N deposition affects trophic interactions and ecosystem functioning is important for predicting the impact of global change on soil ecosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Shengjie"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Behm","given":"Jocelyn E."},{"family":"He","given":"Xinxing"},{"family":"Gan","given":"Jianmin"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Xiaodong"}],"citation-key":"liu.etal2018","container-title":"Ecosphere","DOI":"10.1002/ecs2.2466","ISSN":"2150-8925","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"e02466","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Nitrogen addition changes the trophic cascade effects of spiders on a detrital food web","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecs2.2466","volume":"9"},

Yet it is unclear whether such interactions have similarly resulted in the diversification of the fauna independently of associations with plants. We explore this question for the Collembola genus Seira, which includes 89 species in the CFR, and appears to have diversified substantially into warm, dry fynbos shrublands—habitats atypical of those usually occupied by Collembola. Specifically, we determine whether thermal tolerance is higher for members of the genus in these shrublands compared with congeners in cooler, moister Afrotemperate Forests in the region, and with Collembola globally. Fynbos-inhabiting Seira species have remarkable critical thermal maxima (CTmax) of on average 43°C, 5–6°C higher than congeners occupying the Southern Afrotemperate Forests, and Collembola globally, even when taking CTmax variation associated with regional climate into consideration. Thermal tolerance trait variation among the Seira species from different habitats is likely the consequence of variation in habitat temperature: fynbos shrublands are on average 17°C warmer than Afrotemperate Forests. Moreover, periodic fires in the fynbos have a large effect on microhabitat temperatures, increasing them substantially (by 7.5°C) in the year after fire, which may be especially relevant in selecting for higher thermal tolerance in species from this habitat. These results suggest that the remarkable richness of Seira in the CFR may in part be due to the evolution of very high CTmax values which have enabled them to take advantage of a hot, dry habitat that is unusual for Collembola.

Whether such interactions have also resulted in the diversification of the invertebrate fauna, independently of direct associations with plants is, however, not clear.

Including 89 species in the CFR, many of which are localised habitat specialists, this genus includes many species inhabiting the warm, dry fynbos shrubland—a habitat atypical of usually desiccation-sensitive Collembola. Here, we investigate whether desiccation tolerance may have contributed to the considerable diversity of Seira in the CFR. First, we demonstrate, by measuring vapour pressure deficits (VPD) of the species’ microhabitats (fynbos shrubland and moister Afrotemperate Forests), that the fynbos shrublands are dry environments (mean ± S.E. maximum VPD 5.2 ± 0.1 kPa) compared with the Afrotemperate Forest patches (0.3 ± 0.02 kPa) during the summer activity period of Seira. Then we show that Seira species living in these shrublands are more desiccation tolerant (mean ± S.E. survival time at 76% relative humidity: 74.3 ± 3.3 h) than their congeners in the cooler, moister Afrotemperate Forests (34.3 ± 2.8 h), and compared with Collembola species globally (3.7 ± 0.2 h). These results, and a previous demonstration of pronounced thermal tolerance in the fynbos shrubland species, suggest that the diversity of Seira in the CFR is at least partly due to pronounced desiccation and thermal tolerance, which has enabled species in the genus to exploit the hot and dry habitats of the CFR.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"W.

  {"id":"loeffler-henry.sherratt2024","abstract":"It has long been hypothesized that a species that is relatively easy to catch by predators may face selection to resemble a species that is harder to catch. Several experiments using avian predators have since supported this ‘evasive mimicry’ hypothesis. However, the sudden movement of artificial evasive prey in each of the above experiments may have startled the predators, generating an avoidance response unrelated to difficulty of capture. Additionally in the above experiments the catchability of prey was all or nothing, while in nature predators may occasionally catch evasive prey or fail to catch slower species, which might inhibit learning. Here, using mantids as predators, we conducted an experimental test of the evasive mimicry hypothesis that circumvents these limitations, using live painted calyptrate flies with modified evasive capabilities as prey. We found that mantids readily learned to avoid pursuing the more evasive prey types. Warning signals based on evasiveness and their associated mimicry may be widespread phenomena in nature. These findings not only further support its plausibility but demonstrate that even arthropod predators can select for it.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Loeffler-Henry","given":"Karl"},{"family":"Sherratt","given":"Thomas N."}],"citation-key":"loeffler-henry.sherratt2024","container-title":"Biology Letters","container-title-short":"Biol.

  {"id":"losos2008","abstract":"Ecologists are increasingly adopting an evolutionary perspective, and in recent years, the idea that closely related species are ecologically similar has become widespread. In this regard, phylogenetic signal must be distinguished from phylogenetic niche conservatism. Phylogenetic niche conservatism results when closely related species are more ecologically similar that would be expected based on their phylogenetic relationships; its occurrence suggests that some process is constraining divergence among closely related species. In contrast, phylogenetic signal refers to the situation in which ecological similarity between species is related to phylogenetic relatedness; this is the expected outcome of Brownian motion divergence and thus is necessary, but not sufﬁcient, evidence for the existence of phylogenetic niche conservatism. Although many workers consider phylogenetic niche conservatism to be common, a review of case studies indicates that ecological and phylogenetic similarities often are not related. Consequently, ecologists should not assume that phylogenetic niche conservatism exists, but rather should empirically examine the extent to which it occurs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Losos","given":"Jonathan B."}],"citation-key":"losos2008","container-title":"Ecology Letters","container-title-short":"Ecology Letters","DOI":"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01229.x","ISSN":"1461-023X, 1461-0248","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",10]]},"language":"en","page":"995-1003","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Phylogenetic niche conservatism, phylogenetic signal and the relationship between phylogenetic relatedness and ecological similarity among species","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01229.x","volume":"11"},

For this purpose, variations in physicochemical properties (conductivity, relative humidity, organic matter and pH) and collembolan communities were analyzed by comparing the soils of a natural pine forest and a burned pine forest during the 24 weeks after the fire in 3 different samplings. With the data obtained, a series of diversity indices were calculated and statistical analyses such as ANOVA, hierarchical classification and principal component analysis were developed, with the aim of understanding in greater depth the recovery of collembolan populations, the changes in these physicochemical variables and the relationships between both parameters.\nThis study shows how the fire reduced the amount of organic matter and water, and increased soil pH and conductivity, affecting edaphic fauna populations. In the short term, there was an increase in relative humidity and a decrease in electrical conductivity.\nThe edaphic fauna communities of the burned pine forest increased their diversity and equity without reaching the values of the natural pine forest. At the specific level, however, the springtail populations matched the richness and even reached a very slightly higher Shanon-Wiener diversity index than that the natural pine forest populations in just 24 weeks. Finally, it was observed that the samples from the burned pine forest with recovered collembolan populations had the closest physicochemical parameters to those of the natural pine forest.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Luciáñez","given":"María José"},{"family":"Serena","given":"Alicia"}],"citation-key":"lucianez.serena2024","DOI":"10.20944/preprints202401.0771.v1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,10]]},"language":"en","number":"2024010771","publisher":"Preprints","source":"Preprints.org","title":"Collembola Communities Reflect Soil Recovery After Fire in Mediterranean Pinus pinaster Forests","type":"article","URL":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202401.0771/v1"},

  {"id":"lyu.etal2017","abstract":"The hypotheses suggesting that the nature and strength of species interactions should be determined by phylogenetic relatedness have important implications for the understanding of community structure. However, to date, there is limited empirical evidence to support them. At least two basic conditions need to be met in order to expect species interactions to be determined by evolutionary relatedness: a phylogenetic signal in the traits involved in the interactions and changes in the interactions as species are more ecologically similar. Here, we report results of a removal experiment in the Chinese Tibetan plateau in which we directly assessed if the nature and/or strength of interactions among twelve alpine meadow plant species were influenced by their phylogenetic relatedness and/or their functional dissimilarity. For each plant species, we compared its biomass production when grown alone to its biomass in presence of another species and used it as a measure of species interactions. Competition between pairs of species was more frequent than facilitation, with 60% of interactions resulting in plants producing less biomass when a second species was present. We found no effect of phylogenetic relatedness on the prevalence or intensity of competition or facilitation, presumably as none of the studied traits showed phylogenetic signal. Functional dissimilarity based on maximum plant height alone was the best predictor of both the prevalence and strength of competition and facilitation, followed by functional dissimilarity using all five functional traits. Our results pinpoint the limited capacity of phylogenetic relatedness as predictor of species interactions; underlining the limitations of using phylogenetic dispersion patterns to infer mechanisms of community assembly. On the contrary, when the right functional traits are used, functional dissimilarity among species can predict both the nature and strength of their interactions; accentuating the relevance of trait‐based approaches in community ecology research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Lyu","given":"Shengman"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xiang"},{"family":"Venail","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Shurong"}],"citation-key":"lyu.etal2017","container-title":"Oikos","container-title-short":"Oikos","DOI":"10.1111/oik.03378","ISSN":"0030-1299, 1600-0706","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",3]]},"language":"en","page":"381-388","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Functional dissimilarity, not phylogenetic relatedness, determines interspecific interactions among plants in the Tibetan alpine meadows","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/oik.03378","volume":"126"},

In the classical attempt to understand the processes supporting biodiversity, ecologists are currently seeking to unravel the differential roles of environmental filtering and competition for resources in niche partitioning processes: these processes are in principle distinct although they may act simultaneously, interact at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and are often confounded in studies of soil communities. We used a novel combination of methods based on stable isotopes and trait analysis to resolve these processes in diverse oribatid mite assemblages at spatial scales at which competition for resources could in principle be a major driver. We also used a null model approach based on a general neutral model of beta diversity. A large and significant fraction of community variation was explainable in terms of linear and periodic spatial structures in the distribution of organic C, N and soil structure: species were clearly arranged along an environmental, spatially structured gradient. However, competition related trait differences did not map onto the distances separating species along the environmental gradient and neutral models provided a satisfying approximation of beta diversity patterns. The results represent the first robust evidence that in very diverse soil arthropod assemblages resource-based niche partitioning plays a minor role while environmental filtering remains a fundamental driver of species distribution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Maaß","given":"Stefanie"},{"family":"Maraun","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Scheu","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Rillig","given":"Matthias C."},{"family":"Caruso","given":"Tancredi"}],"citation-key":"maass.etal2015","container-title":"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","container-title-short":"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","DOI":"10.1016/j.soilbio.2015.03.005","ISSN":"0038-0717","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"145-152","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Environmental filtering vs. resource-based niche partitioning in diverse soil animal assemblages","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071715000966","volume":"85"},

Management of the biological component of agricultural soils is a vital aspect of sustainable food production systems. There is a need for soil biology metrics that producers can use as a decision support tool when it comes to managing the soil biological component of agricultural soils. We evaluated the usefulness of nematode community profiling as a soil biology monitoring tool in support of a sustainable commercial-scale tomato production system in South Africa. The objectives were to: (1) study the effects of land use change on nematode communities in the tomato production region, and (2) explore the correlation between tomato crop productivity and the nematode community metrics. The enrichment index was a sensitive indicator of land use change, but the structure index was not. Although the number and proportion of free-living and plant-parasitic nematodes increased and decreased respectively, the selective amplification of specific herbivorous genera was observed. Helicotylenchus spp. was sensitive to land use change and might serve as soil health indicator in this tomato production region. Regression analysis indicated a combination of variables associated with soil pH, free-living nematodes (notably the bacterivores) and specific plant-parasitic nematode genera (Paratrichodorus spp. and Rotylenchus spp.) predicted tomato yield (R2=0.846). Despite the useful information gleaned from the nematode community metrics regarding soil food web functioning, the importance of ecologically and economically important nematode genera was re-emphasized.

  {"id":"manlay.etal2002","abstract":"The assessment of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in agro-ecosystems of West African savannas (WAS) may be a useful tool to define sustainable intensification schemes needed to respond to the rapid increase in local populations as well as global change issues. Changes in soil properties, and particularly in the soil organic matter status, under semi-permanent cultivation were thus examined through a groundnut crop-fallow chronosequence in southern Senegal. The effect of fallowing was mainly restricted to the 0–20 cm soil layer and hardly affected soil physical properties. In this layer, steady improvements were recorded for Mg and Ca contents. Carbon and N amounts increased by 30%, and by 50% for available P (P OD) within the very first year of fallow and then remained steady (C and N) or dropped back to levels recorded for crops (P OD). The rapid initial change in organic status after crop abandonment was attributed to fast recovery of woody vegetation. The steady soil organic matter (SOM) content in oldest fallows compared to young fallows probably resulted from poor protection of soil organic matter from oxidation during biological activity. This hypothesis was confirmed by mesh-bag experiments, which indicated that ¿40–60% of decaying woody root biomass disappeared after 6 months of in situ incubation. In fallow systems in southern Senegal, soil fertility may in fact rely at least as much on fast organic matter cycling in soil food webs as on SOM build-up. Carbon storage in the soil-plant system of mature fallow ecosystems was only 27 t C ha −1 higher than in crops and consisted mainly of pools with fast turnover. Consequently, the potential of semi-permanent cultivation for C sequestration in the WAS will be rather indirect, by a shift to more intensified practices, thus avoiding the conversion of dense forests to cropping in more humid areas.","author":[{"family":"Manlay","given":"Raphaël J"},{"family":"Masse","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Chotte","given":"Jean-Luc"},{"family":"Feller","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Kairé","given":"Maguette"},{"family":"Fardoux","given":"Joël"},{"family":"Pontanier","given":"Roger"}],"citation-key":"manlay.etal2002","container-title":"Agriculture, ecosystems & environment","event-place":"AMSTERDAM","ISSN":"0167-8809","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]},"language":"eng","page":"233-248","publisher":"Elsevier B.V","publisher-place":"AMSTERDAM","title":"Carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus allocation in agro-ecosystems of a West African savanna: II.

  {"id":"martin.etal2024","abstract":"Springtails (subclass: Collembola) represent one of the most extensively studied invertebrate groups in soil ecotoxicology. This is because of their ease of laboratory culture, significant ecological role, and sensitivity to environmental contaminants. Folsomia candida (family: Isotomidae) is a globally widespread parthenogenetic species that is prevalent in laboratory toxicity testing with springtails. Conversely, Arrhopalites caecus (family: Arrhopalitidae), a parthenogenic globular springtail species, remains untested in soil ecotoxicology. This species is found in diverse habitats, including cave systems and forest leaf litter, and has a global distribution. The sensitivity of A. caecus to environmental contaminants, such as neonicotinoid insecticides, as well as its life history and optimal culturing conditions, are largely unknown. The present study describes the establishment of a pure A. caecus laboratory culture and characterization of its life cycle and culturing conditions. We assessed the sensitivity of A. caecus to various insecticides, including exposures to the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam in soil and through a novel feeding assay as well as to clothianidin and cyantraniliprole in spiked soil exposures. In 7‐ and 14‐day exposures to thiamethoxam in agricultural soil, the 50% lethal concentration (LC50) values were determined to be 0.129 mg/kg dry weight and 0.010 mg/kg dry weight, respectively. The 14‐day LC50 for exposure to thiamethoxam via spiked food was determined to be 0.307 mg/kg dry weight. In addition, the 28‐day 50% effect concentration for inhibition of juvenile production from cyantraniliprole exposure in the same soil type was 0.055 mg/kg dry weight. Challenges encountered in using this species included susceptibility to mite infestation and low adult survival rates in the 28‐day cyantraniliprole test.

  {"id":"mateos.etal2021","abstract":"The correct identification of morphological species is a key task for species richness estimation of any ecosystem. Although body colour is a widely used character identifying European Lepidocyrtus species, recent investigations using molecular data have revealed that species delineation using body colour can result in an underestimation of real species diversity because of the presence of cryptic species. Lepidocyrtus violaceus is a European species characterised by its dark violet body colour. Its wide distribution leads us to suspect that several cryptic species can be present within this morphospecies. Since traditional morphological characters have appeared insufficient for real diversity identification in Lepidocyrtus, new morphological characters were needed in order to describe the cryptic diversity detected by molecular data in this genus. Pseudopores are integumentary structures present in all Lepidocyrtus species, but the distribution of these structures has not been properly described in the genus, as well as in Entomobryioidea overall. In the present work we aimed to analyse whether L. violaceus is a monophyletic entity in Europe. Moreover, we aimed to determine if the position and number of pseudopores on the different parts of the body and appendages is a phylogenetically useful character in the identification of the species or superspecific entities. Fourteen populations of L. violaceus from five European countries, and another 25 Lepidocyrtus species from nine European countries have been studied. In total, 208 specimens have been analysed morphologically and half of them were studied molecularly using sequences of the genes COXII and EF-1α. Molecular data revealed that the widely distributed Lepidocyrtus violaceus morphospecies is a polyphyletic entity in Europe. Between 6 and 12 diferent cryptic species have been detected within this European morphospecies, and only the presence of pseudopores on the basal plate of the fourth abdominal segment has been found to be a promising diagnostic character between them. A common basal pattern of pseudopore distribution has been recognised in the European members of the genus, and also a diferential pattern within each European species group. As a general trend, an increase in the number of pseudopores has been detected from the most basal to the most derived species groups in the phylogeny of the genus in Europe.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Mateos","given":"Eduardo"},{"family":"Winkler","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Riutort","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Álvarez-Presas","given":"Marta"}],"citation-key":"mateos.etal2021","container-title":"Invertebrate Systematics","container-title-short":"Invert.

Hopliine beetles proved to be the, or among the, most abundant flower visitors of 12 investigated plant species. However, during single flower observations at three Aizoaceae species, bees (Apoidea), bee flies (Bombyliidae) and pollen wasps (Masaridae) were the most frequent flower visitors. However, monkey beetles carried the highest Asteraceae and Aizoaceae pollen loads, and are therefore considered to play a vital role in the pollination of these two families. Abundance, species richness and diversity of Hopliini did not appear to be heavily affected by livestock grazing. Annual variation in the composition of monkey beetle populations was more dramatic. Still, some species showed higher abundances on heavily grazed rangeland while others only occurred under low grazing pressure. It is presumed that changes in the composition of the vegetation, especially the observed decrease of perennial plants in favour of annuals and geophytes (Todd and Hoffman 1999) could in turn affect the composition of monkey beetle assemblages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Mayer","given":"Carolin"},{"family":"Soka","given":"Geoffrey"},{"family":"Picker","given":"Mike"}],"citation-key":"mayer.etal2006","container-title":"Journal of Insect Conservation","container-title-short":"J Insect Conserv","DOI":"10.1007/s10841-006-9006-0","ISSN":"1572-9753","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"323-333","source":"Springer Link","title":"The importance of monkey beetle (Scarabaeidae: Hopliini) pollination for Aizoaceae and Asteraceae in grazed and ungrazed areas at Paulshoek, Succulent Karoo, South Africa","title-short":"The importance of monkey beetle (Scarabaeidae","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10841-006-9006-0","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"mayfield.levine2010","abstract":"Though many processes are involved in determining which species coexist and assemble into communities, competition is among the best studied. One hypothesis about competitionÕs contribution to community assembly is that more closely related species are less likely to coexist. Though empirical evidence for this hypothesis is mixed, it remains a common assumption in certain phylogenetic approaches for inferring the effects of environmental ﬁltering and competitive exclusion. Here, we relate modern coexistence theory to phylogenetic community assembly approaches to reﬁne expectations for how species relatedness inﬂuences the outcome of competition. We argue that two types of species differences determine competitive exclusion with opposing effects on relatedness patterns. Importantly, this means that competition can sometimes eliminate more different and less related taxa, even when the traits underlying the relevant species differences are phylogenetically conserved. Our argument leads to a reinterpretation of the assembly processes inferred from community phylogenetic structure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Mayfield","given":"Margaret M."},{"family":"Levine","given":"Jonathan M."}],"citation-key":"mayfield.levine2010","container-title":"Ecology Letters","DOI":"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01509.x","ISSN":"1461023X","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",9]]},"language":"en","page":"1085-1093","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Opposing effects of competitive exclusion on the phylogenetic structure of communities: Phylogeny and coexistence","title-short":"Opposing effects of competitive exclusion on the phylogenetic structure of communities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01509.x","volume":"13"},

It is argued that soil has an integral part to play in the global environmental sustainability challenges of food security, water security, energy sustainability, climate stability, biodiversity, and ecosystem service delivery. Indeed, soil has the same existential status as these issues and should be recognized and highlighted similarly. The concept of soil security is multi-dimensional. It acknowledges the five dimensions of (1) capability, (2) condition, (3) capital, (4) connectivity and (5) codification, of soil entities which encompass the social, economic and biophysical sciences and recognize policy and legal frameworks.

  {"id":"mcdougall1971","abstract":"A detailed K-Ar study of subaerial lavas from Réunion, using whole rock samples, shows that the measured ages are fully consistent with the excellent stratigraphic control available. The amount of extraneous radiogenic argon present in three of the groups of basalt flows is about 1 ± 1 × 10−13 mol/g, and for many of the younger lavas the content must be less than 3 × 10−13 mol/g. However, extraneous argon has been detected in alkali feldspar and amphibole in hypabyssal drusy syenites that are exposed in the eroded core of Piton des Neiges volcano. The ages enable part of the history of the two volcanoes comprising Réunion to be elucidated. The subaerial basaltic shield building lavas of Piton des Neiges were erupted during at least three distinct episodes at about 2 m.y., 1.2-1.0 m.y. and 0.55-0.43 m.y. ago. Following a hiatus of about 0.1 m.y. a sequence of alkali andesites and basalts was erupted between about 0.35 and 0.07 m.y. ago. The younger, and still active volcano, Piton de la Fournaise, which is built entirely of basaltic lavas, was active from at least 0.36 m.y. ago. The focus of basaltic eruption has migrated progressively toward the southeast with time, and may indicate that Réunion has moved toward the northwest, away from the southwest branch of the mid-Indian Ocean ridge, across the source region for the magmas in the upper mantle.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"McDougall","given":"Ian"}],"citation-key":"mcdougall1971","container-title":"Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","container-title-short":"Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","DOI":"10.1016/0016-7037(71)90037-8","ISSN":"0016-7037","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1971",3,1]]},"page":"261-288","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The geochronology and evolution of the young volcanic island of Réunion, Indian Ocean","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0016703771900378","volume":"35"},

As most plastic is produced, used and discarded on land,\n~4–23 times more plastics are deposited in soils than in the oceans.\nHowever, there is far too little knowledge on the ecological consequences\nof plastic pollution, especially for soil ecosystems. Microplastics (<5 mm),\nwhether derived from larger plastic pieces through physical, chemical and\nbiological degradation or produced as primary particles, is of considerable\ninterest, as they can be ingested by organisms at the basis of the trophic net and\ntransferred to higher trophic levels.

We studied whether pine tree species diversity, aphid-tending ants and their interaction determined plant performance and arthropod community structure. Plant diversity had a positive effect on aphids, but only in the presence of mutualistic ants, leading to a threefold greater number of both groups in the tri-specific cultures than in monocultures. Plant diversity increased ant abundance not only by increasing aphid number, but also by increasing ant recruitment per aphid. The positive effect of diversity on ants in turn cascaded down to increase plant performance; diversity increased plant growth (but not biomass), and this effect was stronger in the presence of ants. Consequently, bottom-up effects of diversity within the same genus and guild of plants, and top-down effects from the third trophic level (predatory ants), interactively increased plant performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Moreira","given":"Xoaquín"},{"family":"Mooney","given":"Kailen A."},{"family":"Zas","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"Sampedro","given":"Luis"}],"citation-key":"moreira.etal2012","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"morel.etal2014","abstract":"Abstract Regional climate models (RCMs) should be evaluated with respect to their ability to downscale large-scale climate information to the local scales, which are sometimes strongly modulated by surface conditions. This is the case for La Réunion (southwest Indian Ocean) because of its island context and its complex topography. Large-scale atmospheric configurations such as tropical cyclones (TCs) may have an amplifying effect on local rainfall patterns that only a very high-resolution RCM, forced by the large scales and resolving finescale processes, may simulate properly. This paper documents the capability of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) RCM to regionalize rainfall variability at very high resolution (680 m) over La Réunion island for daily to seasonal time scales and year-to-year differences. Two contrasted wet seasons (November–April) are selected: 2000–01 (abnormally dry) and 2004–05 (abnormally wet). WRF rainfall is compared to a dense network of rain gauge records interpolated onto the WRF grid through the regression-kriging (RK) technique. RK avoids the point-to-grid comparison issue, but produces imperfect estimates due to sampling, so its quality also needs to be tested. Seasonal rainfall amounts and contrasts produced by WRF are fairly realistic. At intraseasonal and daily time scales, differences to RK are more sizable. These differences are not easy to interpret in sectors where the rain gauge network is less dense and the quality of RK more uncertain, as over the eastern slopes of Piton de la Fournaise volcano where WRF seems to simulate more realistic rainfall than RK. Finally, the heavy rainfall associated with TC Ando on 6 January 2001, is documented. WRF shows weak disagreements with RK, indicating its capability to regionalize rainfall during extreme events.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Morel","given":"Béatrice"},{"family":"Pohl","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Richard","given":"Yves"},{"family":"Bois","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Bessafi","given":"Miloud"}],"citation-key":"morel.etal2014","DOI":"10.1175/MWR-D-14-00009.1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",8,1]]},"language":"en","section":"Monthly Weather Review","source":"journals.ametsoc.org","title":"Regionalizing Rainfall at Very High Resolution over La Réunion Island Using a Regional Climate Model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/142/8/mwr-d-14-00009.1.xml"},

A majority of the insect orders are represented on the island. We document the current state of knowledge for Mauritian arthropods, with particular focus on the Coleoptera. This is the most diverse order locally with 1,032 species. In addition, it is the best catalogued historically, providing a framework for future conservation studies to evaluate the current status of this group. We explore the current threats facing the native insect fauna and highlight the needs for concern on this vital component of local biodiversity.

We use a food systems model that addresses agronomic characteristics of organic agriculture to analyze the role that organic agriculture could play in sustainable food systems. Here we show that a 100% conversion to organic agriculture needs more land than conventional agriculture but reduces N-surplus and pesticide use. However, in combination with reductions of food wastage and food-competing feed from arable land, with correspondingly reduced production and consumption of animal products, land use under organic agriculture remains below the reference scenario. Other indicators such as greenhouse gas emissions also improve, but adequate nitrogen supply is challenging. Besides focusing on production, sustainable food systems need to address waste, crop–grass–livestock interdependencies and human consumption. None of the corresponding strategies needs full implementation and their combined partial implementation delivers a more sustainable food future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Muller","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Schader","given":"Christian"},{"family":"El-Hage Scialabba","given":"Nadia"},{"family":"Brüggemann","given":"Judith"},{"family":"Isensee","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Erb","given":"Karl-Heinz"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Pete"},{"family":"Klocke","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Leiber","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Stolze","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Niggli","given":"Urs"}],"citation-key":"muller.etal2017","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-017-01410-w","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,14]]},"language":"en","page":"1290","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Strategies for feeding the world more sustainably with organic agriculture","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01410-w","volume":"8"},

The high degree of endemism supports the idea that these island spider faunas are much isolated and that ballooning and island hopping played a minor role during colonization.

  {"id":"parisi.etal2005","abstract":"Traditional approaches to soil quality evaluation were based on the use of physical, chemical and microbiological indicators. Recently, new methods, based on soil microarthropods have been proposed for soil quality evaluation. Soil microarthropods have been shown to respond sensitively to land management practices and to be correlated with beneﬁcial soil functions. In Italy, a new approach (called QBS index) based on the types of edaphic microarthropods has been proposed to assess soil biological quality. The QBS index is based on microarthropod groups present in a soil sample. Each type found in the sample receives a score from 1 to 20 (eco-morphological index, EMI), according to its adaptation to soil environment. The QBS index sums up these scores, thereby characterizing the microarthropod community of the sample being studied. QBS has been applied on a range of soil types and land uses in Italy, its validity evaluated for assessing biological quality of soil in different situations. This paper describes the QBS methods and presents three applications of the proposed methodology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Parisi","given":"Vittorio"},{"family":"Menta","given":"Cristina"},{"family":"Gardi","given":"Ciro"},{"family":"Jacomini","given":"Carlo"},{"family":"Mozzanica","given":"Enrico"}],"citation-key":"parisi.etal2005","container-title":"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","container-title-short":"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.agee.2004.02.002","ISSN":"01678809","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",1]]},"language":"en","page":"323-333","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Microarthropod communities as a tool to assess soil quality and biodiversity: a new approach in Italy","title-short":"Microarthropod communities as a tool to assess soil quality and biodiversity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167880904000970","volume":"105"},

This fossil predicts the occurrence of similar behaviour in living springtails and helps explain the global distribution of Collembola today.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Penney","given":"David"},{"family":"McNeil","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Green","given":"David I."},{"family":"Bradley","given":"Robert S."},{"family":"Jepson","given":"James E."},{"family":"Withers","given":"Philip J."},{"family":"Preziosi","given":"Richard F."}],"citation-key":"penney.etal2012","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS One","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0047651","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",10,17]]},"page":"e47651","PMCID":"PMC3474712","PMID":"23082186","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Ancient Ephemeroptera–Collembola Symbiosis Fossilized in Amber Predicts Contemporary Phoretic Associations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3474712/","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"petersen.luxton1982","abstract":"This work, which was originally part of the IBP synthesis effort, aims at an up-to-date critical review and comparative analysis of structural and functional properties of soil animal populations. It is emphasized that quantification of the metabolism of soil animal populations and their function in soil processes has ultimately been deduced from estimates of density and biomass combined with laboratory data. The comparison of the relative contribution of soil fauna populations in different sites has therefore primarily been based on the extensive information available on the quantitative structure of animal communities. A general evaluation of the density and biomass data discusses the effect of various sampling and extraction factors on the annual mean estimates on which the analysis has been primarily based: sampling design, size and number of sample units, sample depth, sampling period and frequency, efficiency of extraction and method of biomass estimation. The information pertaining to individual sites and soil fauna groups has been condensed into a methodology code which is presented along with site code, site characterization and relevant references. We also present for each main soil fauna group an analysis based on frequency distributions and regressions of biomass against density. The distribution of density and biomass estimates as related to biome, soil moisture, pH, and presence of a top soil organic accumulation horizon has been examined. We treat the size and composition of whole animal communities in various biomes and draw a number of conclusions about large-scale geographical patterns. The conclusions in general confirm theories developed by earlier authors, but the much larger data set analyzed in the present work reveals a number of exceptions and nuances relative to the original simple theories. The difference between the faunal composition and biomass in mull and mor soils is confirmed. An inverse relationship between weight of organic material on the soil surface and the total soil fauna biomass is suggested. A general decrease of total soil fauna biomass is observed from the temperate deciduous forest biome and the secondary grasslands of the same climatic zone northwards to the arctic zone and southwards to the tropical forests and savannas, accompanied by change in composition of the main soil fauna groups. However, ecosystems with comparatively high soil fauna biomass are found in both arctic and tropical regions. We discuss substrate utilization by the soil fauna. Most species (panphytophages) seem to consume both dead plant material and the microbial flora, but some species specialize on one or the other. The information available on food selectivity and palatability is reviewed. Niche exploitation and mechanisms for amelioration of inter- and intra-specific competition for food resources is discussed. We give a critical review of methodology and data available on each of the energetic parameters: consumption, assimilation, respiration, and production. The variability of the estimates obtained for these parameters and the derived energetic efficiency ratios are discussed considering the influence of environmental and biological factors. The proportion of the energy input to the soil which is passed through each of these energetic pathways and its allocation to the major faunal groups has been compared for the relatively few sites which have been sufficiently well studied. We conclude with discussing the general influence of the soil fauna on decomposition and nutrient circulation. The soil fauna appears generally to be responsible for less than about 5% of total decomposer respiration. Thus, their direct contribution to ecosystem metabolism is insignificant. In contrast, the indirect catalytic role of the soil fauna is emphasized. Several different ways in which this may be accomplished are discussed and supported with recent evidence. /// Эта работа является частью обзора исследований в рамках МБП и имеет целью дать современную критическую оценку и сравнительный анализ структурных и функциональных особенностей популяций почвенных животных. Подчеркивается, что количественная оценка метаболизма популяций почвенных животных и их функций в почвенных процессах была в конечном счете построена на основе учета численности и биомассы и в комбинации с данными лабораторных исследований. Сравнение относительного значения популяций почвенной фауны в разных местообитаниях, таким образом, исходно основано на обширной количественной информации по структуре животного населения. Общая оценка данных по численности и биомассе обсуждает влияние разных факторов сбора и экстракции на среднегодовые результаты учетов, на которых основан исходно этот анализ: метод сборов, размеры и число проб, глубина взятия проб, период полевых сборов и их периодичность, эффективность экстракции животных, методы измерения биомассы. Информация по характеристике отдельных местообитаний и групп почвенной фауны сконцентрирована в методологическом коде параллельно с кодом местообитаний, их характеристикой и соответствующей литературой. Мы таюже представляем для каждой основной группы почвенной фауны анализ частоты встречаемости и регрессионной зависимости биомассы и плотности. Исследованы величины численности и билмассы в зависимости от биома, почвенной влажности, рН и наличия поверхностного аккумуляционного горизонта. Мы обработали материал по величине и составу животного населения в целом в разных биомах и сделали некоторые заключения о географических закономерностях в широком масштабе. Выводы в целом подтверждают теории, развиваемые ранее цругими авторами, но большая часть данных, приведенных в этой работе, выявляет ряд исключений и ньюансов в оригинальных простых теориях. Подтверждается различие между фаунистическим составом и бисмассой в муллевых и грубогумусных почвах. Подтверждается обратное соотношение между массой органического материала на поверхности почвы и бисмассой почвенной фауны. наблюдается общее снижение биомассы почвенной фауны от биома листопадных лесов умеренного пояса и вторичных лугов в одной климатической зоне к северу до арктической зоны и к югу к тропическим лесам и саваннам, сопроваждающееся изменением состава основных групп почвенной фауны. Однако, экосистемы с относительно высокой биомассой почвенных животных и в арктических и тропических регионах. Мы обсуждаем утилизацию субстрата почвенными животными. Большинство видов (панфитофаги) потребляют как отмерший растительный материал, так и микрофлору, но некоторые виды специализируются либо на одном, либо на другом. Дан обзор доступной литературы по пищевой избирательности и переваримости пищи. Обсуждается использование нищ и механизмы избегания меж- и внутривидовой конкуренции за пищевые ресурсы. Мы даем критический обзор методологии и доступных данных по каждому из энергетических параметров: потреэлению, ассимиляции, дыханию и продукции. Обсуждаются различия результатов, полученных при измерении этих параметров и соотношения величин энергетической эффективности с учетом влияния экологических и биологических факторов. Отношение поступающей в почву энергии, проходящей по каждому из этих энергетических потоков и ее распределение в большинстве фаунистических групп сравнивается для относительно немногих местообитаний, достаточно хорошо изученных. Мы приводим в заключение дискуссию об общем влиянии почвенных животных на деструкцию и круговорот элементов питания. Почвенная фаунв составляет менее 5% от общей величины сумарного дыхания разрушителей. Таким образом, ее прямое воздействие на метаболизм экосистем незначительно. В противоположность этому подчеркивается косвенная каталитическая роль почвенных животных. Обсуждаются некоторые особенности этих функций животных, подкрепленные современными данными.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Petersen","given":"Henning"},{"family":"Luxton","given":"Malcolm"}],"citation-key":"petersen.luxton1982","container-title":"Oikos","DOI":"10.2307/3544689","ISSN":"0030-1299","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1982"]]},"page":"288-388","publisher":"[Nordic Society Oikos, Wiley]","source":"JSTOR","title":"A Comparative Analysis of Soil Fauna Populations and Their Role in Decomposition Processes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3544689","volume":"39"},

  {"id":"picker1996","abstract":"Colour preferences and flower selection by monkey beetles (Scarabaeidae: Hopllini) were examined at two sites in the Biedouw Valley, near Clanwilliarn, and a site at Darling. Correlation was obtained between the attraction of beetles to colour-traps and the colours of host-plant flowers. Three pollinator guilds were defined on colour preferences and feeding behaviour. A blue/white pollinator guild comprising species of Anisonyx Fabricius and Peritrichia Burmeister were attracted to blue and white traps, and pollinated blue-violet and white flowers. These beetles feed on pollen (and possibly on nectar) and do not imbed themselves in flowers. This, together with their dense pilosity and frequent flower visitation rates, suggests that they are important pollinators. A second embedding guild consists of the genera Scelophysa Gyllenhal, Heterochelus Burmeister, Gymnoloma peringuey, Heterochelus Burmeister and Pachycnema Burmeister. These beetles show pronounced sexual dimorphism and are relatively free of hair. They characteristically embed in species of Asteraceae and Mesembryanthemaceae, feeding on the ray florets, ovule and pollen. They probably have a limited role as pollinators. A third pollen-feeding guild is intermediate between these two guilds. It comprises species of Lepithrix Serville which, like the members of the embedding guild, select red, yellow, orange and white pigments and flowers. They do not embed, but feed superficially on pollen of Asteraceae. They are numerous, active and densely pilose, features indicating that they play an important role as pollinators.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Picker","given":"M.D.* & Midgle J.J.**"}],"citation-key":"picker1996","container-title":"African Entomology","DOI":"10.10520/AJA10213589_177","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996",1]]},"page":"7-14","publisher":"Entomological Society of South Africa (ESSA)","source":"journals.co.za (Atypon)","title":"Pollination by monkey beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Hopliini): flower and colour preferences","title-short":"Pollination by monkey beetles (Coleoptera","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.co.za/doi/abs/10.10520/AJA10213589_177","volume":"4"},

This work raises some serious issues of Senathirajah in the way they combine data and they obtained particle sizes.

Human inﬂuence increased from LUU 1 (old deciduous forest) to LUU 6 (agricultural land mainly devoted to cereal crops), passing by planted coniferous forests (LUU 2) and variegated landscapes made of cereal crops, pastures, hay meadows, conifer plantations and small relict deciduous groves in varying proportion (LUUs 3 – 5). Sixteen core samples were taken inside each LUU, at intersections of a regular grid. Species composition, species richness and total abundance of collembolan communities varied according to land use and landscape properties. Land use types affected these communities through changes in the degree of opening of woody landscape (woodland opposed to grassland) and changes in humus forms (measured by the Humus Index). A decrease in species richness and total abundance was observed from old deciduous forests to cereal crops. Although the regional species richness was not affected by the intensiﬁcation gradient (40– 50 species were recorded in every LUU), a marked decrease in local biodiversity was observed when the variety of land use types increased. In variegated landscapes the observed collapse in local species richness was not due to a different distribution of land use types, since it affected mainly woodland areas. Results indicated the detrimental inﬂuence of the rapid afforestation of previous agricultural land, which did not afford time for the development of better adapted soil animal communities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Ponge","given":"J.F"},{"family":"Gillet","given":"S"},{"family":"Dubs","given":"F"},{"family":"Fedoroff","given":"E"},{"family":"Haese","given":"L"},{"family":"Sousa","given":"J.P"},{"family":"Lavelle","given":"P"}],"citation-key":"ponge.etal2003","container-title":"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","container-title-short":"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","DOI":"10.1016/S0038-0717(03)00108-1","ISSN":"00380717","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",6]]},"language":"en","page":"813-826","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Collembolan communities as bioindicators of land use intensification","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0038071703001081","volume":"35"},

  {"id":"porco.etal2012a","abstract":"Parisotoma notabilis is the most common species of Collembola in Europe and is currently designated as ubiquist. This species has been extensively used in numerous studies and is considered as well characterized on a morphological ground. Despite the homogeneity of its morphology, the sequencing of the barcoding fragment (5′ end of COI) for several populations throughout Europe and North America revealed four distinct genetic lineages. The divergence found between these lineages was similar to the genetic distance among other species of the genus Parisotoma included in the analysis. All four lineages have been confirmed by the nuclear gene 28S. This congruence between mitochondrial and nuclear signals, as well as the geographical distribution pattern of lineages observed in Europe, supports the potential specific status of these lineages.

Collembola constitute a significant and species-rich component of the soil biodiversity, but it remains a woefully understudied group because of the taxonomic impediment. The ever-increasing use of molecular taxonomic tools, such as DNA barcoding, provides a possible solution. Here, we test the use of this approach through a diversity survey of Collembola from the vicinity of Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, and compare the results with previous surveys in the same area and in other sub-Arctic regions. The systematic barcoding campaign at Churchill revealed a diverse collembolan fauna consisting of 97 species-level MOTUs in six types of habitats. If all these MOTUs are confirmed as species, this richness would be far higher than prior records for Arctic Canada and could lead to reconsider the actual diversity of the group in Arctic environments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Porco","given":"David"},{"family":"Skarżyński","given":"Dariusz"},{"family":"Decaëns","given":"Thibaud"},{"family":"Hebert","given":"Paul D.

We followed the appearance of the isotopic label in springtails inhabiting different layers of soil and litter (euedaphic, hemiedaphic and epigeic life forms) after in situ pulse-labelling of spruce trees with 13CCO2. Isotopic label was most frequently observed in euedaphic Collembola (26% of all samples), mainly in Protaphorura armata. The label was very rare in litter-dwelling (hemiedaphic) species (4%). Surprisingly, the label was often observed in epigeic Collembola (11%). During the period of 44days after labelling, the proportion of labelled samples increased with time in euedaphic, but not in epigeic species, suggesting that freshly fixed carbon is assimilated by these collembolan groups via different pathways. Most likely, euedaphic species are trophically linked to plant roots, whereas epigeic species receive freshly fixed carbon from aboveground. The exact mechanisms and potential importance of the latter pathway should be evaluated in further research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Potapov","given":"Anton M."},{"family":"Goncharov","given":"Anton A."},{"family":"Tsurikov","given":"Sergey M."},{"family":"Tully","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Tiunov","given":"Alexei V."}],"citation-key":"potapov.etal2016","container-title":"Pedobiologia","container-title-short":"Pedobiologia","DOI":"10.1016/j.pedobi.2016.07.002","ISSN":"0031-4056","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"189-193","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Assimilation of plant-derived freshly fixed carbon by soil collembolans: Not only via roots?","title-short":"Assimilation of plant-derived freshly fixed carbon by soil collembolans","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031405616300385","volume":"59"},

  {"id":"potapov.etal2017","abstract":"Large pools of organic carbon are stored in deep soil horizons (subsoil). Decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) is driven by microorganisms that are in turn grazed by metazoan animals. Microbial populations and animal food webs in the soil are both at least partly dependent on labile organic carbon provided by plant roots. In this study, we described the vertical distribution of total Corg, microbial biomass, root biomass and the density of soil arthropods in deep layers (down to 110–210 cm depth) of three soils formed under the south taiga, broadleaved forest and forested steppe vegetation. By modeling the vertical distribution of animal population we estimated the soil depths above which 90% of the animals live (SD90 values). These values were the highest for Collembola, Protura and Symphyla (43–116, 69–144 and 54–95 cm, respectively, across the study locations), but relatively low for Acari (32–55 cm). In the forested steppe, less than 50% of all microarthropods and less than 10% of all insects inhabited litter and the uppermost 10 cm of mineral soil. Using generalized linear mixed-effect models we showed that the distribution of Collembola in the subsoil (below 30 cm) depended on root biomass and total Corg content, while the distribution of mites was affected by total Corg content and microbial biomass. The density of collembolans correlated significantly with root biomass both in the upper and lower parts of the soil profile. This suggests that soil fauna are involved in deep soil C cycling largely via grazing on root-associated microorganisms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Potapov","given":"Anton M."},{"family":"Goncharov","given":"Anton A."},{"family":"Semenina","given":"Eugenia E."},{"family":"Korotkevich","given":"Anastasiya Yu"},{"family":"Tsurikov","given":"Sergey M."},{"family":"Rozanova","given":"Oksana L."},{"family":"Anichkin","given":"Alexander E."},{"family":"Zuev","given":"Andrey G."},{"family":"Samoylova","given":"Ekaterina S."},{"family":"Semenyuk","given":"Irina I."},{"family":"Yevdokimov","given":"Ilya V."},{"family":"Tiunov","given":"Alexei V."}],"citation-key":"potapov.etal2017","container-title":"European Journal of Soil Biology","container-title-short":"European Journal of Soil Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejsobi.2017.09.001","ISSN":"1164-5563","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"88-97","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Arthropods in the subsoil: Abundance and vertical distribution as related to soil organic matter, microbial biomass and plant roots","title-short":"Arthropods in the subsoil","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1164556317302352","volume":"82"},

Predators are often larger than their prey in food chains, but empirical evidence for positive body mass–trophic level scaling for entire food webs mostly comes from marine communities on the basis of unicellular producers. Using published data on stable isotope compositions of 1,093 consumer species, we explored how trophic level scales with body size, food web type (green vs. brown), and phylogenetic group across biomes. In contrast to widespread assumptions, the relationship between body size and trophic level of consumers—from protists to large vertebrates—was not signiﬁcant per se but varied among ecosystem types and animal groups. The correlation between body size and trophic level was strong in marine consumers, weak in freshwater consumers, and absent in terrestrial consumers, which was also observed at the scale of local food webs. Vertebrates occupied higher trophic positions than invertebrates, and green trophic chains were longer than brown ones in aquatic (primarily marine) but not in terrestrial food webs. Variations in body size of top predators suggest that terrestrial and many freshwater food webs are size compartmentalized, implying different trophic dynamics and responses to perturbations than in size-structured marine food webs.","author":[{"family":"Potapov","given":"Anton M"},{"family":"Brose","given":"Ulrich"},{"family":"Scheu","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Tiunov","given":"Alexei V"}],"citation-key":"potapov.etal2019","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"17","source":"Zotero","title":"Trophic Position of Consumers and Size Structure of Food Webs across Aquatic and Terrestrial Ecosystems","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"potapov.etal2019b","abstract":"Animals that have similar morphological traits are expected to share similar ecological niches. This statement applies to individual animals within a species and thus species often serve as the functional units in ecological studies. Species are further grouped into higher-ranked taxonomic units based on their morphological similarity and thus are also expected to be ecologically similar. On the other hand, theory predicts that strong competition between closely related species may result in differentiation of ecological niches. Due to high diversity and limited taxonomic expertise, soil food webs are often resolved using supraspecific taxa such as families, orders or even classes as functional units. Here, we tested the trophic differentiation and consistency of supraspecific taxa across major lineages of temperate forest soil invertebrates: Annelida, Chelicerata, Myriapoda, Crustacea and Hexapoda. Published data on stable isotope compositions of carbon and nitrogen were used to infer basal resources and trophic level, and explore the relationship between taxonomic and trophic dissimilarity of local populations. Genera and families had normal and unimodal distributions of isotopic niches, suggesting that supraspecific taxa are trophically consistent. The isotopic niche of local populations varied considerably resulting in large overlap of niches among species. Within the same genus, the effect of species identity on stable isotope composition of populations was not significant in 92% of cases. More than 50% of the variability in Δ15N values (trophic level) across lineages was explained by classes and orders, while the variability in Δ13C values (basal resources) was explained mostly by families and genera. The variability in stable isotope composition in Chelicerata and Hexapoda was explained by lower taxonomic ranks than in Myriapoda. We compiled a comprehensive list of mean Δ13C and Δ15N values of invertebrate taxa from temperate forest soils allowing to refine soil food web models when measurements of trophic niches of local populations are not feasible. Supraspecific taxa are meaningful as trophic nodes in food web studies, but the consistency varies among taxa and the choice of taxonomic resolution depends on the research question; generally, identification of taxa should be more detailed in more diverse taxonomic groups.

  {"id":"potapov.etal2019c","abstract":"Despite the major importance of soil biota in nutrient and energy fluxes, interactions in soil food webs are poorly understood. Here we provide an overview of recent advances in uncovering the trophic structure of soil food webs using natural variations in stable isotope ratios. We discuss approaches of application, normalization and interpretation of stable isotope ratios along with methodological pitfalls. Analysis of published data from temperate forest ecosystems is used to outline emerging concepts and perspectives in soil food web research. In contrast to aboveground and aquatic food webs, trophic fractionation at the basal level of detrital food webs is large for carbon and small for nitrogen stable isotopes. Virtually all soil animals are enriched in 13C as compared to plant litter. This ‘detrital shift’ likely reflects preferential uptake of 13C-enriched microbial biomass and underlines the importance of microorganisms, in contrast to dead plant material, as a major food resource for the soil animal community. Soil organic matter is enriched in 15N and 13C relative to leaf litter. Decomposers inhabiting mineral soil layers therefore might be enriched in 15N resulting in overlap in isotope ratios between soil-dwelling detritivores and litter-dwelling predators. By contrast, 13C content varies little between detritivores in upper litter and in mineral soil, suggesting that they rely on similar basal resources, i.e. little decomposed organic matter. Comparing vertical isotope gradients in animals and in basal resources can be a valuable tool to assess trophic interactions and dynamics of organic matter in soil. As indicated by stable isotope composition, direct feeding on living plant material as well as on mycorrhizal fungi is likely rare among soil invertebrates. Plant carbon is taken up predominantly by saprotrophic microorganisms and channelled to higher trophic levels of the soil food web. However, feeding on photoautotrophic microorganisms and non-vascular plants may play an important role in fuelling soil food webs. The trophic niche of most high-rank animal taxa spans at least two trophic levels, implying the use of a wide range of resources. Therefore, to identify trophic species and links in food webs, low-rank taxonomic identification is required. Despite overlap in feeding strategies, stable isotope composition of the high-rank taxonomic groups reflects differences in trophic level and in the use of basal resources. Different taxonomic groups of predators and decomposers are likely linked to different pools of organic matter in soil, suggesting different functional roles and indicating that trophic niches in soil animal communities are phylogenetically structured. During last two decades studies using stable isotope analysis have elucidated the trophic structure of soil communities, clarified basal food resources of the soil food web and revealed links between above- and belowground ecosystem compartments. Extending the use of stable isotope analysis to a wider range of soil-dwelling organisms, including microfauna, and a larger array of ecosystems provides the perspective of a comprehensive understanding of the structure and functioning of soil food webs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Potapov","given":"Anton M."},{"family":"Tiunov","given":"Alexei V."},{"family":"Scheu","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"potapov.etal2019c","container-title":"Biological Reviews","DOI":"10.1111/brv.12434","ISSN":"1469-185X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"37-59","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Uncovering trophic positions and food resources of soil animals using bulk natural stable isotope composition","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/brv.12434","volume":"94"},
  {"id":"potapov.etal2020","abstract":"Collembola are among the most abundant and diverse soil microarthropods, which are found in almost all (semi)terrestrial environments and often serve as model organisms in empirical studies. Diverse data collected on the biology and ecology of Collembola over the last century are waiting for synthesis studies, while developing technologies may facilitate generation of new knowledge. Collembola research in 2020 is entering the stage of global synthesis and in this opinion paper we address the main challenges that the community of collembologists is facing on this avenue. We first discuss the present status and social context of Collembola taxonomy and the potential use of novel technologies to describe new species. We then focus on aspects of community ecology, reviewing the processes of dispersal, environmental and biotic filtering, from the spatial scale of microhabitat to the globe. We also discuss the involvement of Collembola in ecosystem processes and which proxies, such as functional traits, can be used to predict the functional roles of species. Finally, we provide recommendations on how we can improve community data collection by using standard methods and better data handling practices. We call for (1) integrating morphological descriptions with high-resolution photographs and genetic barcodes for species descriptions and developing of user friendly software and machine learning approaches to facilitate deposition of structured taxonomic knowledge on web platforms; (2) multiscale studies on biodiversity distribution and community processes, especially including dispersal mechanisms; (3) recording and sharing functional, not only morphological, trait data in controlled experiments and field surveys; (4) knowledge synthesis and meta-analysis studies on the topics of ecosystem roles of Collembola, conservation of its diversity, feeding behaviour, protection mechanisms and dispersal of different Collembola species, and effects of land use and climate change on collembolan communities; (5) joint efforts in covering the gaps in Collembola knowledge, especially in underexplored regions (predominantly tropics and subtropics) using standard methodologies; (6) data sharing and its integration in open structured databases. We believe that Collembola studies could make use of new technologies and ongoing changes in society. To facilitate the progress across these research topics by 2040, we have established #GlobalCollembola, a distributed-effort community-driven initiative that aims to provide open and global data on Collembola taxonomic and genetic diversity, abundance, traits and literature and to coordinate global efforts in covering the key knowledge gaps.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Potapov","given":"Anton M."},{"family":"Bellini","given":"Bruno C"},{"family":"Chown","given":"Steven L"},{"family":"Deharveng","given":"Louis"},{"family":"Janssens","given":"Frans"},{"family":"Kováč","given":"Ľubomír"},{"family":"Kuznetsova","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Ponge","given":"Jean-François"},{"family":"Potapov","given":"Mikhail"},{"family":"Querner","given":"Pascal"},{"family":"Russell","given":"David"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Xin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Berg","given":"Matty P"}],"citation-key":"potapov.etal2020","container-title":"soil organisms","DOI":"10.25674/so92iss3pp161","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12]]},"page":"161-188","source":"HAL Archives Ouvertes","title":"Towards a global synthesis of Collembola knowledge: challenges and potential solutions","title-short":"Towards a global synthesis of Collembola knowledge","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03040767","volume":"92"},

We assessed correlations among trophic niche parameters and described variation of these parameters in different Collembola species, families and across life‐forms, which represent microhabitat specialisation.\n                \n                \n                  Correlation between trophic niche parameters was weak in 45 out of 64 pairwise comparisons, pointing at complementarity of the four methods. Jointly, the results indicated that fungal‐ and plant‐feeding Collembola assimilate storage, rather than structural polysaccharides, and suggested bacterial feeding as a potential alternative feeding strategy. Gut content and fatty acid analyses suggested alignment between ingestion and assimilation/retention processes in fungal‐ and plant‐feeding Collembola. From the 15 trophic niche parameters, six were related to Collembola family identity, suggesting that not all trophic niche dimensions are phylogenetically structured.

  {"id":"potapov.etal2022a","abstract":"Here we introduce the Soil BON Foodweb Team, a cross-continental collaborative network that aims to monitor soil animal communities and food webs using consistent methodology at a global scale. Soil animals support vital soil processes via soil structure modification, direct consumption of dead organic matter, and interactions with microbial and plant communities. Soil animal effects on ecosystem functions have been demonstrated by correlative analyses as well as in laboratory and field experiments, but these studies typically focus on selected animal groups or species at one or few sites with limited variation in environmental conditions. The lack of comprehensive harmonised large-scale soil animal community data including microfauna, mesofauna, and macrofauna, in conjunction with related soil functions, limits our understanding of biological interactions in soil communities and how these interactions affect ecosystem functioning. To provide such data, the Soil BON Foodweb Team invites researchers worldwide to use a common methodology to address six long-term goals: (1) to collect globally representative harmonised data on soil micro-, meso-, and macrofauna communities; (2) to describe key environmental drivers of soil animal communities and food webs; (3) to assess the efficiency of conservation approaches for the protection of soil animal communities; (4) to describe soil food webs and their association with soil functioning globally; (5) to establish a global research network for soil biodiversity monitoring and collaborative projects in related topics; (6) to reinforce local collaboration networks and expertise and support capacity building for soil animal research around the world. In this paper, we describe the vision of the global research network and the common sampling protocol to assess soil animal communities and advocate for the use of standard methodologies across observational and experimental soil animal studies. We will use this protocol to conduct soil animal assessments and reconstruct soil food webs on the sites included in the global soil biodiversity monitoring network, Soil BON, allowing us to assess linkages among soil biodiversity, vegetation, soil physico-chemical properties, and ecosystem functions. In the present paper, we call for researchers especially from countries and ecoregions that remain underrepresented in the majority of soil biodiversity assessments to join us. Together we will be able to provide science-based evidence to support soil biodiversity conservation and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Potapov","given":"Anton M."},{"family":"Sun","given":"Xin"},{"family":"Briones","given":"Maria J.

  {"id":"potapov.etal2022b","abstract":"Organic farming technologies are increasingly being used to reduce environmental pollution and grow environmentally friendly products. An integrated approach to assessing the effectiveness of these technologies requires studying the reaction of various components of agroecosystems, including soil fauna. Collembola (springtails) are among the most abundant soil arthropods that regulate nutrient cycling in crop fields. However, the effects of different management types on Collembola communities are context-dependent, and spatial organization of these communities remains unexplored. Here, we studied winter wheat fields in European Russia using a large spatial sampling including 486 samples which were arranged in a nested fractal pattern and grouped into 18 meter plots across six agricultural fields. We compared fields with organic farming (no mineral fertilizer and pesticide applications, moderate tillage) with conventional farming ones. To account for spatial configuration of the sampling design, we applied generalized linear mixed-effects models. The organic farming with moderate tillage changed the structure of Collembola communities by reducing the effect of species over-domination. However, the total abundance and species richness of Collembola was only little and often non-significantly higher under organic than in under the conventional management type. The applied multiscale approach revealed larger spatial aggregations in Collembola communities in organic than in conventional management. Overall, we showed that the effect of organic farming technologies changes taxonomic and spatial structures of Collembola communities, rather their bulk characteristics, such as density and abundance. Functional consequences of these changes are yet to be discovered.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Potapov","given":"Mikhail B."},{"family":"Bokova","given":"Anna I."},{"family":"Janion-Scheepers","given":"Charlene"},{"family":"Kuznetsova","given":"Natalia A."},{"family":"Merk","given":"Miryam S."},{"family":"Panina","given":"Ksenia S."},{"family":"Potapov","given":"Anton M."},{"family":"Saraeva","given":"Anna K."}],"citation-key":"potapov.etal2022b","container-title":"SOIL ORGANISMS","DOI":"10.25674/so94iss2id173","ISSN":"2509-9523","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,1]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2022 SOIL ORGANISMS","number":"2","page":"99-110","source":"www.soil-organisms.org","title":"Organic farming and moderate tillage change the dominance and spatial structure of soil Collembola communities but have little effects on bulk abundance and species richness","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.soil-organisms.org/index.php/SO/article/view/173","volume":"94"},

These systems rely on ecosystem services provided by natural ecosystems, including pollination, biological pest control, maintenance of soil structure and fertility, nutrient cycling and hydrological services. Preliminary assessments indicate that the value of these ecosystem services to agriculture is enormous and often underappreciated. Agroecosystems also produce a variety of ecosystem services, such as regulation of soil and water quality, carbon sequestration, support for biodiversity and cultural services. Depending on management practices, agriculture can also be the source of numerous disservices, including loss of wildlife habitat, nutrient runoff, sedimentation of waterways, greenhouse gas emissions, and pesticide poisoning of humans and non-target species. The tradeoffs that may occur between provisioning services and other ecosystem services and disservices should be evaluated in terms of spatial scale, temporal scale and reversibility. As more effective methods for valuing ecosystem services become available, the potential for ‘win–win’ scenarios increases. Under all scenarios, appropriate agricultural management practices are critical to realizing the benefits of ecosystem services and reducing disservices from agricultural activities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Power","given":"Alison G."}],"citation-key":"power2010","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Phil.

  {"id":"pryke.samways2010","abstract":"Conserving biodiversity on mountains holds particular challenges, with topographic species beta diversity being high. In turn, conserving mountain biodiversity in the heart of a biodiversity hotspot, with intense urbanization on its lower slopes, poses further challenges. We investigate here an iconic mountain at the southern tip of Africa, which is under multiple human pressures, while receiving much conservation attention. We sought here some general principles to guide conservation management of this and other similar mountains. Our focal organisms were surface-active invertebrates, as they are abundant, diverse, and environmentally sensitive at point localities. We show that vegetation structure and elevation were the most important environmental variables determining this diversity. Type of fynbos vegetation, proximity of forest to a river, aspect, and abundance of the alien Argentine ant Linepithema humile, had no significant influence. Suburban woodland species richness and abundance had a non-significant difference to that of natural forest. Fynbos had high species beta diversity of invertebrates, suggesting that large areas of this dominant vegetation type should be conserved. However, many specialist and highly local endemic species were in forest, highlighting the irreplaceability of forest habitats. Such a mountain, with its complex topography, requires total protection, as there is no room for loss of any part of the mountain. We emphasize that, while the upper slope and summit are well protected, the lower slopes are in need of urgent attention, a situation which mirrors that in Europe.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Pryke","given":"J.

  {"id":"quinby.etal2020","abstract":"1. The use of stable isotope analysis (SIA) in ecological research has dramatically increased in recent years largely because it allows researchers to investigate ecological questions that have been previously difficult to address. 2. Ecological applications of SIA include estimating fundamental niche space and overlap, evaluating trophic or species level interactions, and investigating food web structure. Increasingly, researchers have been incorporating SIA in studies of animal migration, disease transmission, diet composition, nutrient assimilation, and body condition among others. 3. Studies using SIA to evaluate the ecology of terrestrial insects have lagged behind other taxonomic groups. This poor representation of stable isotope studies in publications likely stems from a lack of familiarity of entomologists with this technique. 4. An improved understanding of SIA, as well as the advantages and disadvantages specifically related to insect research, will benefit the field of entomology. In addition, insect-model systems provide unique opportunities for entomologists to incorporate SIA in their research to advance our knowledge of insect biology and the stable isotope ecology of insects. 5. We provide background information on stable isotopes, explain sources of isotopic variation, describe the processes of how isotopes are differentially routed and incorporated into an individual's tissues, explain the principles that influence isotopic fractionation and discrimination, highlight different methods and advancements in SIA, review innovative stable isotope studies, and provide an overview of common mistakes, considerations, and future directions entomologists can explore.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Quinby","given":"Brandon M."},{"family":"Creighton","given":"J.

The MOG clade, comprising Metastelmatinae, Oxypetalinae, and Gonolobinae, probably colonized South America through transoceanic dispersal from Africa at 32 Ma. The three subtribes emerged at 24 Ma, radiating 15-16 Ma. Cynanchum L. subg. Mellichampia (A. Gray) Woodson (Cynanchinae) only arrived in the New World at 24 Ma and has since diversified gradually. Asclepias L. (Asclepiadinae) probably arrived in the New World through the Bering Strait at 20 Ma, dispersing to South America before the emergence of the Isthmus of Panama. More recently, tropical Marsdenia R. Br. (Marsdenineae) probably arrived in the New World by long-distance dispersal at 16 Ma.

  {"id":"raposeiro.etal2022","abstract":"Background\nThe Madeira Island (Portugal; 32°24’–33°07’N, 16°16–17°16’W; 796 km2) is an oceanic island located in the North Atlantic, about 980 km south of Portugal and about 700 km west of the African coast. The presence of freshwater invertebrates in oceanic islands has always raised questions concerning dispersal, colonisation and evolution. Therefore, the freshwater fauna of Madeira Island has attracted the interest of many researchers in the past, the first publications going back to the nineteenth century. Initial studies were mainly taxonomic, resulting in a checklist of the Madeira freshwater macroinvertebrates with 240 taxa. As typical from oceanic islands, freshwater invertebrates are characterised by low diversity, with some taxonomic groups absent. Although freshwater Madeiran macroinvertebrates are a well-studied group, geographical information of diversity distribution is still scarce. Therefore, more studies are needed, especially georeferenced data of diversity and distribution of macroinvertebrate assemblages, to provide valuable information for improving knowledge and the development of typologically appropriate monitoring and conservation programmes and restoration strategies for local stakeholders.\n\nNew information\nThe results of the present study revealed 713 occurrences in 40 sampling points in Madeira Island streams. The occurrence data showed 70 different aquatic taxa belonging to 21 orders and 53 families. Amongst our occurrence data, 15 endemic taxa (22.1%) from Madeira Archipelago were found. In addition, different families of Collembola and different taxa of Copepoda (Onychiuridae, Poduridae, Isotomidae, Entomobryidae, Sminthuridae) comprised new records for the Madeira streams. Therefore, further taxonomic and ecological studies on freshwater invertebrates from Madeira Island should be done with a particular focus on these lesser-known groups. Thus, our data increase the geographical data distribution of freshwater macroinvertebrates and their diversity in Madeira Island. This database is an update of geographical information of diversity distribution of Madeira freshwater macroinvertebrates known groups. This information is essential for a better understanding of community composition, diversity, occurrence or spatial distribution, which will help explore different research questions on different research areas, such as community ecology and biogeography.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Raposeiro","given":"Pedro M."},{"family":"Balibrea","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Riva","given":"Julie-Camile"},{"family":"Ritter","given":"Catarina Johanna Fernandes Rodrigues"},{"family":"Gonçalves","given":"Vítor"}],"citation-key":"raposeiro.etal2022","container-title":"Biodiversity Data Journal","container-title-short":"Biodivers Data J","DOI":"10.3897/BDJ.10.e73909","ISSN":"1314-2836","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,18]]},"page":"e73909","PMCID":"PMC8881431","PMID":"35233170","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Aquatic macroinvertebrates in Madeira Island (Portugal) streams: diversity and distribution","title-short":"Aquatic macroinvertebrates in Madeira Island (Portugal) streams","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8881431/","volume":"10"},

Here we reflect on this perspective and contest that the view of GC conflicts with some basic and indisputable principles underpinning the philosophy of science, most notably: it must be free. They appear to believe that taxonomic revisions should be based on political, economic and conservation concerns, and they treat species as fixed real entities, instead of refutable scientific hypotheses.

  {"id":"ratnasingham.hebert2013","abstract":"Because many animal species are undescribed, and because the identification of known species is often difficult, interim taxonomic nomenclature has often been used in biodiversity analysis. By assigning individuals to presumptive species, called operational taxonomic units (OTUs), these systems speed investigations into the patterning of biodiversity and enable studies that would otherwise be impossible. Although OTUs have conventionally been separated through their morphological divergence, DNA-based delineations are not only feasible, but have important advantages. OTU designation can be automated, data can be readily archived, and results can be easily compared among investigations. This study exploits these attributes to develop a persistent, species-level taxonomic registry for the animal kingdom based on the analysis of patterns of nucleotide variation in the barcode region of the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene. It begins by examining the correspondence between groups of specimens identified to a species through prior taxonomic work and those inferred from the analysis of COI sequence variation using one new (RESL) and four established (ABGD, CROP, GMYC, jMOTU) algorithms. It subsequently describes the implementation, and structural attributes of the Barcode Index Number (BIN) system. Aside from a pragmatic role in biodiversity assessments, BINs will aid revisionary taxonomy by flagging possible cases of synonymy, and by collating geographical information, descriptive metadata, and images for specimens that are likely to belong to the same species, even if it is undescribed. More than 274,000 BIN web pages are now available, creating a biodiversity resource that is positioned for rapid growth.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Ratnasingham","given":"Sujeevan"},{"family":"Hebert","given":"Paul D.

We hypothesized that traits and not biogeographic origin of novel plant communities will determine community structure of organisms that depend on plants for habitat or as a food resource. We tested the functional redundancy of novel tree communities by verifying if six pairs of congeneric European and North American tree species bearing similar leaf litter traits resulted in similar ecological filters influencing the assembly of springtail (Collembola) communities at two sites. Litter biogeographic origin (native versus non-native) did not influence springtail community structure, but litter genus, which generally reflected trait differences, did.

The abundance of individuals per species and species diversity were analyzed and the results were used to compare the impact of each cropping system on springtails. We hypothesized that the low-input cropping system (i.e., pasture) would enhance springtail abundance and diversity, whereas high-input cropping systems (e.g., continuous corn) would negatively impact springtails. Although some data supported our initial hypothesis, other cases showed that the low-input pasture system did not favor springtail abundance and diversity, nor did agronomic disturbance necessarily affect these parameters negatively. This suggests that factors other than cropping system can inßuence springtail populations.

  {"id":"rechou.etal2019","abstract":"Weather forecasting is challenging because of the complex interplay between local conditions and regional atmospheric forcings. In this article, we analyse the relationships between local daily rainfall and large-scale synoptic patterns in the geographical context of Réunion Island, a high volcanic island in the southwestern Indian Ocean basin. Given the critical role of trade winds on weather conditions at island scale, we analyse those relationships across seasons defined with respect to yearly trade-wind regimes. The analysis of the distribution of inversion events' elevation and frequency allows us to characterize the trade-wind inversion layer (TWIL) and identify four seasons with homogeneous distributions. We characterize the spatio-temporal variability of rainfall measured at island scale by a dense network of rain-gauges over 37 years and relate it to large-scale weather regimes identified using geopotential height meteorological data. After seasonal signal removal using Fourier transforms and dimension reduction via Principal Component Analysis, we perform Canonical Correlation Analysis to identify canonical variables relating rainfall and geopotential height patterns at the two different studied spatial scales. We then combine Ascending Hierarchical Classification and partitioning k-means methods to identify homogeneous large-scale synoptic conditions within each season. From this information, we build composite maps of geopotential height that characterize weather regimes and further analyse rainfall patterns at island scale in each regime. Elevation and orientation are used as descriptive variables at island scale as they strongly structure the patterns. Overall, four homogeneous seasons were identified based on trade-wind regimes, within which six large-scale weather regimes were identified for summer, the most variable season, and four for the others. Finally, rainfall patterns at island scale are described in relation to the highlighted synoptic regimes and local descriptive variables.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Réchou","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Flores","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Jumaux","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Duflot","given":"Valentin"},{"family":"Bousquet","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Pouppeville","given":"Chloé"},{"family":"Bonnardot","given":"Francois"}],"citation-key":"rechou.etal2019","container-title":"Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society","DOI":"10.1002/qj.3485","ISSN":"1477-870X","issue":"720","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2019 Royal Meteorological Society","page":"893-909","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Spatio-temporal variability of rainfall in a high tropical island: Patterns and large-scale drivers in Réunion Island","title-short":"Spatio-temporal variability of rainfall in a high tropical island","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qj.3485","volume":"145"},

  {"id":"rendell.whitehead2001","abstract":"Studies of animal culture have not normally included a consideration of cetaceans. However, with several long-term field studies now maturing, this situation should change. Animal culture is generally studied by either investigating transmission mechanisms experimentally, or observing patterns of behavioural variation in wild populations that cannot be explained by either genetic or environmental factors. Taking this second, ethnographic, approach, there is good evidence for cultural transmission in several cetacean species. However, only the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops) has been shown experimentally to possess sophisticated social learning abilities, including vocal and motor imitation; other species have not been studied. There is observational evidence for imitation and teaching in killer whales. For cetaceans and other large, wide-ranging animals, excessive reliance on experimental data for evidence of culture is not productive; we favour the ethnographic approach. The complex and stable vocal and behavioural cultures of sympatric groups of killer whales (Orcinus orca) appear to have no parallel outside humans, and represent an independent evolution of cultural faculties. The wide movements of cetaceans, the greater variability of the marine environment over large temporal scales relative to that on land, and the stable matrilineal social groups of some species are potentially important factors in the evolution of cetacean culture. There have been suggestions of gene-culture coevolution in cetaceans, and culture may be implicated in some unusual behavioural and life-history traits of whales and dolphins. We hope to stimulate discussion and research on culture in these animals.","author":[{"family":"Rendell","given":"Luke"},{"family":"Whitehead","given":"Hal"}],"citation-key":"rendell.whitehead2001","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Culture in whales and dolphins","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"revenga.etal2005","abstract":"Human activities have severely affected the condition of freshwater ecosystems worldwide. Physical alteration, habitat loss, water withdrawal, pollution, overexploitation and the introduction of non-native species all contribute to the decline in freshwater species. Today, freshwater species are, in general, at higher risk of extinction than those in forests, grasslands and coastal ecosystems. For North America alone, the projected extinction rate for freshwater fauna is five times greater than that for terrestrial fauna—a rate comparable to the species loss in tropical rainforest. Because many of these extinctions go unseen, the level of assessment and knowledge of the status and trends of freshwater species are still very poor, with species going extinct before they are even taxonomically classified.\n            Increasing human population growth and achieving the sustainable development targets set forth in 2002 will place even higher demands on the already stressed freshwater ecosystems, unless an integrated approach to managing water for people and ecosystems is implemented by a broad constituency. To inform and implement policies that support an integrated approach to water management, as well as to measure progress in halting the rapid decline in freshwater species, basin-level indicators describing the condition and threats to freshwater ecosystems and species are required. This paper discusses the extent and quality of data available on the number and size of populations of freshwater species, as well as the change in the extent and condition of natural freshwater habitats. The paper presents indicators that can be applied at multiple scales, highlighting the usefulness of using remote sensing and geographical information systems technologies to fill some of the existing information gaps. Finally, the paper includes an analysis of major data gaps and information needs with respect to freshwater species to measure progress towards the 2010 biodiversity targets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Revenga","given":"C"},{"family":"Campbell","given":"I"},{"family":"Abell","given":"R"},{"family":"Villiers","given":"P","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Bryer","given":"M"}],"citation-key":"revenga.etal2005","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Phil.

  {"id":"richards.etal2015","abstract":"Phytochemical diversity is a key component of functional diversity. Challenges in quantifying phytochemical diversity have limited our understanding of the causes and consequences of variation in phytochemical diversity across plant species and families. Here we show that phytochemical diversity across dozens of plant species predicts herbivore diversity, herbivore specialization, phototoxicity, herbivory, and attack by natural enemies. Our approach and findings provide a framework for future investigations focused on uncovering chemical underpinnings of trophic interactions at realistic ecological, geographic, and taxonomic scales, and have implications for the conservation of functional and taxonomic diversity., What are the ecological causes and consequences of variation in phytochemical diversity within and between plant taxa? Despite decades of natural products discovery by organic chemists and research by chemical ecologists, our understanding of phytochemically mediated ecological processes in natural communities has been restricted to studies of either broad classes of compounds or a small number of well-characterized molecules. Until now, no studies have assessed the ecological causes or consequences of rigorously quantified phytochemical diversity across taxa in natural systems. Consequently, hypotheses that attempt to explain variation in phytochemical diversity among plants remain largely untested. We use spectral data from crude plant extracts to characterize phytochemical diversity in a suite of co-occurring plants in the tropical genus Piper (Piperaceae). In combination with 20 years of data focused on Piper-associated insects, we find that phytochemical diversity has a direct and positive effect on the diversity of herbivores but also reduces overall herbivore damage. Elevated chemical diversity is associated with more specialized assemblages of herbivores, and the cascading positive effect of phytochemistry on herbivore enemies is stronger as herbivore diet breadth narrows. These results are consistent with traditional hypotheses that predict positive associations between plant chemical diversity, insect herbivore diversity, and trophic specialization. It is clear from these results that high phytochemical diversity not only enhances the diversity of plant-associated insects but also contributes to the ecological predominance of specialized insect herbivores.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Richards","given":"Lora A."},{"family":"Dyer","given":"Lee A."},{"family":"Forister","given":"Matthew L."},{"family":"Smilanich","given":"Angela M."},{"family":"Dodson","given":"Craig D."},{"family":"Leonard","given":"Michael D."},{"family":"Jeffrey","given":"Christopher S."}],"citation-key":"richards.etal2015","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1504977112","ISSN":"0027-8424","issue":"35","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,1]]},"page":"10973-10978","PMCID":"PMC4568244","PMID":"26283384","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Phytochemical diversity drives plant–insect community diversity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4568244/","volume":"112"},

  {"id":"rogers.cruz-rivera2021","abstract":"The use of quantitative invertebrate community indices to monitor inland water quality is widespread. However, this approach is rare for the Caribbean, where the dominant animal groups are substantially different from those in continental waters and surface water availability is strongly influenced by seasonality. For the United States Virgin Islands, these limitations are amplified by a general lack of biodiversity data on non-marine aquatic environments. To begin bridging this knowledge gap, we surveyed 41 inland aquatic sites on the island of St. Thomas and adjacent Water Island and Saba Island. Samples were obtained from lotic and lentic habitats, phytotelmata, rural and urban areas, and natural and anthropogenic settings. Out of 118 taxa across 591 records, 46% were first records for the islands sampled, with 23.4% of these being new to the US Virgin Islands territory. Shrimps and snails dominated lotic environments taxonomically, whereas insects dominated lentic environments and phytotelmata. Two confirmed undescribed species were encountered, but this is likely underestimated given the large number of juveniles encountered for some insect groups and the need for a taxonomic revision of multiple genera. The most common and widespread species was the invasive snail Melanoides tuberculata. When sampling periods or multiple samples from the same site were compared, only a 36–42% similarity was found, suggesting a much higher biodiversity than currently appreciated for these seasonally fluctuating habitats. Deep knowledge of inland aquatic biodiversity is necessary to establish baselines to assess watershed health and develop management and conservation plans in the US Virgin Islands, which in turn may be applied to other Caribbean islands.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Rogers","given":"D.

Soil biological sciences are strongly affected by the taxonomic crisis, and most groups of animals in that biota suffer from a strong taxonomic impediment. The objective of this work was to investigate how DNA barcoding - a novel method using a microgenomic tag for species identification and discrimination - permits better evaluation of the taxonomy of soil biota. A total of 1,152 barcode sequences were analyzed for two major groups of animals, collembolans and earthworms, which presented broad taxonomic and geographic sampling. Besides strongly reflecting the taxonomic impediment for both groups, with a large number of species-level divergent lineages remaining unnamed so far, the results also highlight a high level (15%) of cryptic diversity within known species of both earthworms and collembolans. These results are supportive of recent local studies using a similar approach. Within an impeded taxonomic system for soil animals, DNA-assisted identification tools can facilitate and improve biodiversity exploration and description. DNA-barcoding campaigns are rapidly developing in soil animals and the community of soil biologists is urged to embrace these methods.\n          , \n            A biodiversidade das comunidades do solo continua muito pouco conhecida e entendida.

In addition, we found no evidence for trophic cascades in terrestrial soil food webs, but the bacterivorous component of soil fauna influenced plant productivity and microbial biomass more than did the fungivorous component. Furthermore, changes in the biomass of soil fauna differentially affected plant productivity among plant functional groups: a higher biomass of soil fauna increased aboveground productivity by 70% in coniferous systems. However, in ecosystems dominated by legumes, a functional group with lower inorganic nitrogen requirements, there was no response of aboveground productivity to increases in the biomass of soil fauna.

In general, the effect of the number of plant functional groups on the densities of collembolan taxa was stronger than that of plant species richness. Changes in Collembola density and diversity in part was likely caused by increased soil microbial and fine root biomass in treatments with higher plant functional group diversity. The presence of legumes resulted in an increase in the densities of total Collembola, Symphypleona/Neelipleona and Isotomidae indicating that they benefited from the high litter quality and the increased microbial biomass in the rhizosphere of legumes. The results suggest that microbivorous soil invertebrates are controlled by food quality rather than quantity.

They possess attributes for bioindication and have shown high sensitivity to environmental changes during succession. However, few studies have focused on changes in functional community profiles and the factors shaping them with time. We sampled heathlands of different restoration ages located in East Belgium, studied traits of oribatid mite communities of a chronosequence, and assessed the interaction between traits and abiotic variables using community weighted means (CWM) and an iterative co-correlation analysis between abiotic parameters, species trait attributes and species abundances (iterative RLQ analysis). Our study suggests that moisture preferences, concealability (i.e. defence mechanism against desiccation and predation), and body length were the dominant traits structuring the oribatid mite communities. We found that both dispersal and environmental filters shape the assembly of oribatid mite communities, but these drivers dominate different stages of succession. Moreover, trait assemblages deriving from three well-defined eco-morphological groups closely followed these constraints in time. Thus, the shifting dominance of specific groups provides valuable insight on the soil community functioning in a changing environment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Salazar-Fillippo","given":"Andrés A."},{"family":"Srinivasan","given":"Janani"},{"family":"Bij","given":"A.

Diversity, richness and evenness indices indicated differences between ant assemblages, with samples near to the highway (<4 m) having the highest species diversity, and farthest ones (32 m) having the lowest. As measured environmental variables did not explain much of the variation in the species spatial pattern, it appears that the ants were influenced mostly by interspecific competition and/or distribution of food resources, especially road kills. Pheidole megacephala was highly dominant at all sites and was negatively associated with several other species. This and other dominant species appeared to be influencing the abundance of the rarer ones. Dominance and high abundances of species in the genera Pheidole, Monomorium, Tetramorium and Paratrechina, along with the occurrence of certain grasses, indicated that the whole sampling area was disturbed. In a suburban setting, a narrow roadside verge (<4m) is probably adequate. However, for maximum diversity in rural areas, roadsides should be as wide as possible and also rich and heterogenous in native vegetation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Samways","given":"M.

  {"id":"santos.etal2024","abstract":"Palynological assemblages from palaeo-islands are scarce in the fossil record and represent an opportunity to explore plant dispersal patterns and colonization strategies in isolated ecosystems. We present a palynological study of a Middle Jurassic volcanic island located in a shallow epicontinental sea, c. 150 km from the palaeo-mainland. The study is based on a 2-m thick succession of calcareous marlstones in the El Pedregal Formation in the eastern part of the Iberian Basin, and the palaeo-island is termed Camarena Island after the village nearest to the fossil site. Eleven samples yielded equivalent assemblages that are here treated as a single palynological suite containing 47 fossil-species belonging to 36 fossil-genera. The abundance of Araucariacites australis and Klukisporites variegatus, together with accessory Cycadopites spp. and the scarcity of Callialasporites turbatus, Manumia irregularis, Staplinisporites caminus and Kekryphalospora distincta, suggest a Toarcian–Aalenian age. Additional stratigraphical data resolve the likely age for the Camarena Island as lower–middle Aalenian. Many palynomorphs in this assemblage have apparent anemophilous and hydrophilous adaptations facilitating long-distance transport. On this basis, some parent plants probably derive from the adjacent mainland or neighbouring islands. Marine palynomorphs or pollen and spores with few adaptations for dispersal may have derived from plant groups that evolved in situ on the volcanic island. The palynological assemblage has some differences from coeval palynofloras from the central Iberian Peninsula, but there are also some similarities with assemblages from post-volcanic deposits and other oceanic islands. It is likely that the seaway separating the volcanic island from the mainland acted as a biological filter enabling colonization by only a selected range of plant groups.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Santos","given":"Artai A."},{"family":"Rodríguez-Barreiro","given":"Iván"},{"family":"McLoughlin","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Pons","given":"Denise"},{"family":"Valenzuela-Ríos","given":"Jose I."},{"family":"Diez","given":"José B."}],"citation-key":"santos.etal2024","container-title":"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology","container-title-short":"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology","DOI":"10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112081","ISSN":"0031-0182","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,1]]},"page":"112081","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Plant colonization of isolated palaeoecosystems: Palynology of a Middle Jurassic extinct volcanic island (Camarena, Teruel, eastern Spain)","title-short":"Plant colonization of isolated palaeoecosystems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018224000701","volume":"639"},

The semi-automated classification of the imagery was accomplished by manual selection of training points representing water and non-water classes along the entire global coastline. Polygon topology was applied to the GSV, resulting in a new characterisation of the number and size of global islands. Three size classes of islands were mapped: continental mainlands (5), islands greater than 1 km2 (21,818), and islands smaller than 1 km2 (318,868). The GSV represents the shore zone land and water interface boundary, and is a spatially explicit ecological domain separator between terrestrial and marine environments. The development and characteristics of the GSV are presented herein. An approach is also proposed for delineating standardised, high spatial resolution global ecological coastal units (ECUs). For this coastal ecosystem mapping effort, the GSV will be used to separate the nearshore coastal waters from the onshore coastal lands. The work to produce the GSV and the ECUs is commissioned by the Group on Earth Observations (GEO), and is associated with several GEO initiatives including GEO Ecosystems, GEO Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) and GEO Blue Planet.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Sayre","given":"Roger"},{"family":"Noble","given":"Suzanne"},{"family":"Hamann","given":"Sharon"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Wright","given":"Dawn"},{"family":"Breyer","given":"Sean"},{"family":"Butler","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Van Graafeiland","given":"Keith"},{"family":"Frye","given":"Charlie"},{"family":"Karagulle","given":"Deniz"},{"family":"Hopkins","given":"Dabney"},{"family":"Stephens","given":"Drew"},{"family":"Kelly","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Basher","given":"Zeenatul"},{"family":"Burton","given":"Devon"},{"family":"Cress","given":"Jill"},{"family":"Atkins","given":"Karina"},{"family":"Van Sistine","given":"D.

Isotope ratios of C (δ13C) and N (δ15N) were measured in herbivorous and detritivorous invertebrate groups, namely lumbricid earthworms (7 species), enchytraeid worms (3 species), slugs (3 taxa), and their potential food sources in an arable system. Intrapopulation δ15N variation in the slug Deroceras reticulatum (n=52) was large (range 4.2‰), possibly reflecting spatial variability in the food sources. Significant correlations between C:N ratios and isotope ratios in earthworms suggest that factors other than feeding may influence isotopic patterns. One enchytraeid species, Enchytraeus buchholzi, was enriched in 13C and strongly depleted in 15N compared to all other groups. Invertebrates formed a continuum when considered in relation to C and N separately, but fell into two distinct groups on the basis of combined C and N isotope ratios. The less enriched group represents herbivorous and litter-feeding species, while the more enriched group represents soil feeders. It is concluded that δ13C measurements could provide a means of assigning separate baseline δ15N values to primary and secondary decomposers, which in turn could improve the inference of higher trophic levels, omnivory and intraguild predation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Olaf"},{"family":"Curry","given":"James P"},{"family":"Dyckmans","given":"Jens"},{"family":"Rota","given":"Emilia"},{"family":"Scrimgeour","given":"Charles M"}],"citation-key":"schmidt.etal2004","container-title":"Pedobiologia","container-title-short":"Pedobiologia","DOI":"10.1016/j.pedobi.2003.12.003","ISSN":"0031-4056","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",3,31]]},"language":"en","page":"171-180","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Dual stable isotope analysis (δ13C and δ15N) of soil invertebrates and their food sources","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031405604000101","volume":"48"},

  {"id":"sechi.etal2014","abstract":"The introduction of white clover in grassland is a common practice to improve the quality of the pasture and to limit the use of industrial sources of inorganic fertilizer N inputs. However, little is known about the extent to which the introduction of different crop compositions affects soil quality in general, and soil biota in particular. Recent studies have shown that epedaphic and euedaphic Collembola can have distinct differences in feeding strategy that suggests trophic niche differentiation according to soil habitat. Combining fatty acid (FA) biomarkers with the carbon isotopic ratios technique, we investigated belowground trophic interactions. We compared the FA composition of the three most predominant groups of Collembola (Isotoma spp., Lepidocyrtus cyaneus and Poduromorpha) and bulk soil in white clover-only, a grass-clover mixture, and grass-only plots. Differences between FA-d13C of Collembola groups and the FA-d13C signatures of potential food sources (plant material and soil microorganisms) were calculated to explore trophic links in the three cropping combinations. Collembola showed difference in FA compositions between groups. We observed a lower amount of neutral lipid fatty acids (NLFAs) in Isotoma spp. compared to L. cyaneus. Poduromorpha showed a higher relative percentage of the NLFAs 16:1u7 and 20:4 compared to L. cyaneus, and of 18:3 compared to Isotoma spp. The NLFA oleic/ linoleic ratio (18:1u9/18:2u6,9) ratio was higher in Poduromorpha compared to L. cyaneus in all the treatments. Soil FA analysis highlighted a larger fungal/bacterial ratio in grass compared to clover plots, while in Collembola no differences in the FA pattern were detected in relation to the treatments. Nevertheless, results of d13C fractionation in Collembola disclosed differences in the food sources used depending on the crop composition. Apparently, Isotoma spp. and L. cyaneus fed on clover-related diet in clover plots and more on grass-related diet in mixture treatments while Poduromorpha fed more on a plant-related diet, such as leaf litter, in the mixture treatment. Our results suggest differentiation in Collembola feeding strategy and in the diet in relation to food availability and palatability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Sechi","given":"Valentina"},{"family":"D'Annibale","given":"Alessandra"},{"family":"Ambus","given":"Per"},{"family":"Sárossy","given":"Zsuzsa"},{"family":"Krogh","given":"Paul Henning"},{"family":"Eriksen","given":"Jørgen"},{"family":"Holmstrup","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"sechi.etal2014","container-title":"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","container-title-short":"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","DOI":"10.1016/j.soilbio.2014.02.019","ISSN":"00380717","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",7]]},"language":"en","page":"31-38","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Collembola feeding habits and niche specialization in agricultural grasslands of different composition","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0038071714000728","volume":"74"},

The natural difference in the isotopic composition of carbon (C) between the spruce and maize allowed us to estimate the proportions of different carbon sources in the tissues of soil animals. The dependence on litter-derived C was least pronounced in Collembola having low δ15N values, indicating the feeding on non-vascular plants. In contrast, collembolans having high δ15N values belonged to the food chains based on fresh plant residuals. These results suggest that different species of litter-dwelling collembolans may regulate substantially different energy channels.

  {"id":"senn.etal2014","abstract":"Managers of threatened species often face the dilemma of whether to keep populations separate to conserve local adaptations and minimize the risk of outbreeding, or whether to manage populations jointly to reduce loss of genetic diversity and minimise inbreeding. In this study we examine genetic relatedness and diversity in three of the five last remaining wild populations of dama gazelle and a number of captive populations, using mtDNA control region and cytochrome b data. Despite the sampled populations belonging to the three putative subspecies, which are delineated according to phenotypes and geographical location, we find limited evidence for phylogeographical structure within the data and no genetic support for the putative subspecies. In the light of these data we discuss the relevance of inbreeding depression, outbreeding depression, adaptive variation, genetic drift, and phenotypic variation to the conservation of the dama gazelle and make some recommendations for its future conservation management. The genetic data suggest that the best conservation approach is to view the dama gazelle as a single species without subspecific divisions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Senn","given":"Helen"},{"family":"Banfield","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Wacher","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Newby","given":"John"},{"family":"Rabeil","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Kaden","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Kitchener","given":"Andrew C."},{"family":"Abaigar","given":"Teresa"},{"family":"Silva","given":"Teresa Luísa"},{"family":"Maunder","given":"Mike"},{"family":"Ogden","given":"Rob"}],"citation-key":"senn.etal2014","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0098693","editor":[{"family":"Joger","given":"Ulrich"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",6,23]]},"language":"en","page":"e98693","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Splitting or Lumping?

  {"id":"simmons.coleman2008","abstract":"In the southeastern United States, conservation tillage techniques are used to conserve soil nutrients and structure, providing habitat and substrate for biota, which are largely responsible for the mineralization of nutrients in the soil. A deterrent for growers considering the transition to conservation tillage is the delay in soil response (e.g. increased soil carbon, efficient nutrient cycling, impacts on yield) associated with the equilibration of the soil food web. The objective of this study was to determine if the microbial community composition and biomass changed with transition to conservation tillage. Soils sampled from five sites, representing a chronosequence of conservation tillage (from conventionally tilled to 30 year no-till), were collected for fatty acid analysis. Microbial communities were significantly different among sites. Fungi, characterized by 18:2ω6, 18:1ω9, and 18:3ω6c fatty acids, were typically lowest in the conventionally tilled soil, probably due to repeated disruption of the fungal hyphae associated with tillage. In all soils, soil nutrient concentrations, moisture and microarthropod abundance were correlated with microbial structure. Plots in conservation tillage were significantly different from the conventionally tilled plots, but did not exhibit a clear linear pattern across the chronosequence. This evidence that belowground food webs can respond quickly to a cessation in tillage suggests that the delay in soil response may be due more to the time required to build organic matter than to a slow response by the biota.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Simmons","given":"Breana L."},{"family":"Coleman","given":"David C."}],"citation-key":"simmons.coleman2008","container-title":"Applied Soil Ecology","container-title-short":"Applied Soil Ecology","DOI":"10.1016/j.apsoil.2008.08.003","ISSN":"0929-1393","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"518-528","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Microbial community response to transition from conventional to conservation tillage in cotton fields","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139308001303","volume":"40"},
  {"id":"sinthumule2023","abstract":"In various parts of Africa, scholars have paid a great deal of attention to TEK, focusing mainly on their role in biodiversity conservation or natural resource management. Despite individual efforts made so far, the consolidated information about the role of TEK in biodiversity conservation remains uncertain in Africa. A systematic literature search on the role of TEK in biodiversity conservation was conducted on ISI Web of Science (WoS), Scopus and Google Scholar databases. The search produced 40 papers in 12 countries in Africa that were published between 2001 and 2022. Majority of studies on TEK (40%;\n              n\n              = 16) reported in the reviewed literature were from West Africa and no study was found in North Africa. The study found the regular use of different but interrelated forms of TEK in Africa. These include taboos and totems, customs and rituals, rules and regulations, metaphors and proverbs, traditional protected areas (social institutions), local knowledge of plants, animals and landscapes, and resource management systems. Although these forms of TEK have great potential for\n              in situ\n              natural resource management, metaphors and proverbs were found to be least addressed (\n              n\n              = 4) component of TEK. Despite TEK having played a significant role in biodiversity conservation in present-day Africa, the traditions are being threatened by changing cultural mores and practices (including Christianity and Islam), formal education, modernisation and new political dispensations. The findings of this study demonstrate that large geographic areas remain unexplored and this may hide part of the narrative. Reviewed literature suggests that metaphors and proverbs are least represented. New studies should be dedicated towards filling these gaps. Based on these findings, recommendations are provided to improve management practices for TEK in Africa.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Sinthumule","given":"Ndidzulafhi I."}],"citation-key":"sinthumule2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Environmental Science","container-title-short":"Front.

The experiment tested whether no-tillage with mulch (NT), could boost biological activity of soil macrofauna population in continuous maize monocropping system compared with rotational tillage with mulch (RT) and conventional tillage (CT). Soil macrofauna was sampled at the end of the 2014/2015 growing season using 25 × 25 × 25 cm steel monoliths. The mean density of individual orders was higher (p < 0.001) under NT (46%) and RT (38%) compared with CT (16%). However, the Shannon-Weaver index revealed that the diversity and evenness of orders were similar for all treatments. Macrofauna patterns revealed that NT and RT contained higher (p < 0.001) population of Isoptera and Diplopoda. Isoptera was 51% and 17% higher in NT than CT and RT, while in Diplopoda, NT was 39% and 2% higher than CT and RT, respectively. It was concluded that NT and RT systems favoured the development of macrofauna communities in the studied maize continuous monoculture cropping system but did not favour order diversity of macrofauna. This suggests the importance of crop rotation for the development of the more diverse macrofaunal population.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Sithole","given":"Nkanyiso J."},{"family":"Magwaza","given":"Lembe S."},{"family":"Mafongoya","given":"Paramu L."},{"family":"Thibaud","given":"Guy R."}],"citation-key":"sithole.etal2018","container-title":"Acta Agriculturae Scandinavica, Section B — Soil & Plant Science","container-title-short":"Acta Agriculturae Scandinavica, Section B — Soil & Plant Science","DOI":"10.1080/09064710.2017.1381276","ISSN":"0906-4710, 1651-1913","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,3]]},"language":"en","page":"220-229","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Long-term impact of no-till conservation agriculture on abundance and order diversity of soil macrofauna in continuous maize monocropping system","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09064710.2017.1381276","volume":"68"},

The tribe Neanurini, being the second largest within Neanurinae, comprises over 170 species belonging to 29 genera, distributed in the northern hemisphere only, except two species that have been distributed worldwide presumably by human activities. A cladistic analysis of the tribe was reconstructed based on 68 morphological characters. The ingroup comprises 39 species, representing extant genera of Neanurini, including monotypic genera, while outgroups include 5 species of each known tribe according to Cassagnau’s tribal classification. Both equal- and implied-weighting parsimony analyses were used in phylogenetic reconstruction. The cladistic analyses were based on a comprehensive survey of adult morphological characters because specimens suitable for molecular studies were not available for most taxa. The phylogenetic analysis resulted in the recognition of the tribe Neanurini as non-monophyletic because three of the five outgroups nested within the members of Neanurini. The genera Caucasanura, Catalanura, Endonura, Kalanura, Neanura, Protanura and Pumilinura were recovered as paraphyletic. The genera of Neanurini were subdivided into five clades.

  {"id":"soto-adames2002a","abstract":"Color pattern was one of the most important characters used to diagnose species in the genus Lepidocyrtus until the introduction of chaetotaxy to Collembola taxonomy. Chaetotaxy confirmed most species diagnoses based only on color patterns, but a number of populations with distinct pigmentation patterns have been found to be identical in all other morphological characters. The absence of individuals showing intermediate color patterns prompted Yoshii to suggest that, despite chaetotaxic identity, populations with distinct color forms represent valid species (implying reproductive isolation and therefore biological species) in what he designated as “color pattern species.” In Puerto Rico Lepidocyrtus biphasis, L. dispar, and L. caprilesi show a remarkable variation in pigmentation and as a group include 11 different color forms. Here I present a phylogenetic analysis of the cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI) in 17 species of Lepidocyrtus and Pseudosinella, including 11 species and 10 color forms of Puerto Rican Lepidocyrtus, to test Yoshii’s color pattern species concept. The analysis shows large genetic distances between species defined based on morphology alone (morphospecies) and between most color variants within morphospecies. The most often used calibration for the COI molecular clock (2.3% sequence divergence per million years) suggests that morphospecies diverged between 20 and 25 million years before present while color forms within morphospecies diverged between 8 and 19 million years ago. This indicates that changes in climate and sea levels during the Pleistocene were irrelevant to the speciation process in the Puerto Rican Lepidocyrtus. Examination of the genetic variation, phylogenetic relationships, and collection data in light of the biological and phylogenetic species concepts supports the hypothesis that most populations of morphospecies differing only in color pattern are distinct species, thus validating Yoshii’s color pattern species concept. As a result it is suggested that morphological characters traditionally used in species diagnoses are very conservative indicators of genetic divergence, that the diversity of springtails has been greatly underestimated, and that studies concerned with identifying factors promoting speciation in Collembola could be misled if they do not include analysis of mitochondrial markers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Soto-Adames","given":"Felipe N."}],"citation-key":"soto-adames2002a","container-title":"Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution","container-title-short":"Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution","DOI":"10.1016/S1055-7903(02)00250-6","ISSN":"1055-7903","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",10,1]]},"page":"27-42","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Molecular phylogeny of the Puerto Rican <i>Lepidocyrtus</i> and <i>Pseudosinella</i> (Hexapoda: Collembola), a validation of Yoshii’s “color pattern species”","title-short":"Molecular phylogeny of the Puerto Rican <i>Lepidocyrtus</i> and <i>Pseudosinella</i> (Hexapoda","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790302002506","volume":"25"},
  {"id":"soto-adames2010","abstract":"The taxonomic status of the four New World species of Salina MacGillivray with bidentate mucro is uncertain. The first two species to be described, S. bidentata (Handschin) and S. wolcotti Folsom, are so poorly described by modern standards that it is unclear if they represent distinct species or the same, colour-pattern variable forms. This contribution presents additions to the description of S. beta Christiansen &amp; Bellinger based on the holotype, a redescription of S. bidentata and S. wolcotti based on freshly collected material from Costa Rica, Puerto Rico and Florida, USA, and description of a new species, S. thibaudi, from Costa Rica and Guadaloupe. Based on analysis of chaetotaxic patterns it is concluded that S. bidentata and S. wolcotti are distinct species, although it remains unclear if S. ventricolor Gruia, from Cuba is distinct from S. wolcotti. The discovery in Costa Rica and Guadaloupe of S. thibaudi, showing a distinct chaetotaxy, but with colour pattern identical to that illustrated in the original description of S. wolcotti, suggests that records of S. wolcotti outside Puerto Rico require verification.

  {"id":"sousa.etal2004","abstract":"Collembola communities were sampled along a gradient of soil-use intensiﬁcation in a typical Mediterranen landscape dominated by cork-oak. This gradient ranged from a land-use unit (LUU1) dominated by closed oak forest with minimum intervention to an unit entirely composed of a monoculture crop submitted to frequent anthropogenic disturbances (LUU6), passing through LUUs with managed woodland (LLU2) or dominated by open cork-oak areas and pastures (LUU3 and LUU5). The Collembola community in the overall area was dominated by a few abundant species, mainly Isotomidae, present in almost all units. Abundance, diversity and species richness decreased along the gradient, with the agricultural site presenting an impoverished community. Diversity descriptors were positively and signiﬁcantly correlated with habitat diversity, measured on the basis of the proportion of the different soil-use types present at each land-use unit. Multivariate analysis revealed changes in Collembola community composition between the LUUs, with LUU6 detaching from the rest. LUU1 and LUU2, despite the less diverse community of the latter, formed a separate group from the remaining two units (LUU3 and LUU5). Species composition in all these units was mainly determined by soil-use types present at each LUU (open cork-oak land and pastures vs. closed cork-oak areas), the proportion of the different soil-use types and the different management practices adopted for each soil use. Overall analysis revealed that Collembola reacted to changes in the landscape structure, with community composition giving a more robust response than diversity indices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Sousa","given":"José Paulo"},{"family":"Da Gama","given":"Maria Manuela"},{"family":"Pinto","given":"Cristina"},{"family":"Keating","given":"António"},{"family":"Calhôa","given":"Filipa"},{"family":"Lemos","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Castro","given":"Catarina"},{"family":"Luz","given":"Tiago"},{"family":"Leitão","given":"Pedro"},{"family":"Dias","given":"Susana"}],"citation-key":"sousa.etal2004","container-title":"Pedobiologia","container-title-short":"Pedobiologia","DOI":"10.1016/j.pedobi.2004.06.004","ISSN":"00314056","issue":"5-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",12]]},"language":"en","page":"609-622","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effects of land-use on Collembola diversity patterns in a Mediterranean landscape","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0031405604000769","volume":"48"},

Here we present the first molecular study of the microbial diversity associated with the rhizosphere soil of endemic plants of the Proteaceae family (Leucospermum truncatulum and Leucadendron xanthoconus). Genomic DNA was extracted from L. truncatulum rhizosphere soil, L. xanthoconus rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil and used as a template for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA). Construction and sequencing of 16S rDNA libraries revealed a high level of biodiversity and led to the identification of several novel bacterial phylotypes. The bacterial community profiles were compared by 16S rDNA denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Cluster analysis and biodiversity indices revealed that the rhizosphere soil samples were more similar to each other than to non-rhizosphere soil and the rhizosphere soil contained a bacterial diversity that was richer and more equitable compared with non-rhizosphere soil. A Chloroflexus and an Azospirillum genospecies were restricted to the L. xanthoconus rhizosphere soil and Stenotrophomonas genospecies was identified in all rhizosphere soil samples but was not present in the non-rhizosphere soil. Taxon-specific nested PCR and DGGE-identified differences between the Proteaceae plant rhizosphere soil with a Frankia genospecies restricted the L. truncatulum rhizosphere.

  {"id":"stanton.etal2019","abstract":"Species delimitation is one of the most contested areas in modern biology, with widespread disagreement about almost every aspect of the definition and implementation of the “species” label. While this debate is intellectually stimulating, it also has real implications for conservation, where its impacts on taxonomic inflation or inertia can mean that specific populations receive adequate conservation measures or are ignored. Recently, the rise of next generation sequencing and phylogenomics has revolutionised phylogenetic understanding of many organismal groups but has simultaneously highlighted the porosity of genomes in terms of admixture across previously delineated species barriers. The extraordinary power of genomic data is increasingly being used to delineate species, and several publications in this domain have recently attracted significant attention and criticism. Here we revisit the question of species delimitation, but from a genomic context. We ask how and whether the large amounts of data provided by genomic methods can resolve the longstanding discussion on the validity and application of phylogenetic and allied species concepts, and how some recent examples can inform this debate. We argue that conserving adaptive potential is a priority for conservation, and no single species concept currently does that adequately on its own. Genomic data holds the potential to add unprecedented detail, but frequently falls short of this potential.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Stanton","given":"David W.

  {"id":"strasberg.etal2005","abstract":"Most natural habitat in the Mascarene Islands (Mauritius, La Re´ union and Rodrigues) has been transformed. Although urbanisation, agriculture and alien plant invasions have transformed large areas in La Re´ union, the island has by far the greatest area of intact habitats in the Mascarenes, but remaining natural areas are under threat. We propose a protocol for deﬁning a system of habitat types and for using these to provide a preliminary assessment of conservation priorities for La Re´ union. The protocol draws on existing data and expert knowledge to map habitat types, assesses the extent of habitat transformation, and quantiﬁes heterogeneity between habitat types based on climate, topography and geology. The pattern of habitat transformation was uneven among the nineteen habitat types identiﬁed. While three habitats have lost > 95% of their original area, four still retain > 80% of their original extent. Habitat types could be grouped into the following categories: (i) transformed habitats with low levels of plant endemism, (ii) habitats conﬁned to homogenous geology with high levels of plantendemism, and (iii) species-rich heterogeneous habitats on diverse geological types. Priority habitats were also identiﬁed using municipalities as a basis for implementation. Urgent action is required for several habitat types where a large part of the original extent has been transformed. Three municipalities which contain more than 10 habitat types should receive conservation priority. The analysis provides the basis for setting conservation priorities in La Re´ union at the regional and local scale. Implications of the results are discussed with reference to requirements for ﬁner-scale conservation planning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Strasberg","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Rouget","given":"Mathieu"},{"family":"Richardson","given":"David M."},{"family":"Baret","given":"Stephane"},{"family":"Dupont","given":"Joel"},{"family":"Cowling","given":"Richard M."}],"citation-key":"strasberg.etal2005","container-title":"Biodiversity and Conservation","container-title-short":"Biodivers Conserv","DOI":"10.1007/s10531-004-0258-2","ISSN":"0960-3115, 1572-9710","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",11]]},"language":"en","license":"http://www.springer.com/tdm","page":"3015-3032","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"An Assessment of Habitat Diversity and Transformation on La Réunion Island (Mascarene Islands, Indian Ocean) as a Basis for Identifying Broad-scale Conservation Priorities","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10531-004-0258-2","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"strijk.etal2012","abstract":"Madagascar is surrounded by archipelagos varying widely in origin, age and structure. Although small and geologically young, these archipelagos have accumulated disproportionate numbers of unique lineages in comparison to Madagascar, highlighting the role of waif-dispersal and rapid in situ diversification processes in generating endemic biodiversity. We reconstruct the evolutionary and biogeographical history of the genus Psiadia (Asteraceae), a plant genus with near equal numbers of species in Madagascar and surrounding islands. Analyzing patterns and processes of diversification, we explain species accumulation on peripheral islands and aim to offer new insights on the origin and potential causes for diversification in the Madagascar and Indian Ocean Islands biodiversity hotspot. Our results provide support for an African origin of the group, with strong support for non-monophyly. Colonization of the Mascarenes took place by two evolutionary distinct lineages from Madagascar, via two independent dispersal events, each unique for their spatial and temporal properties. Significant shifts in diversification rate followed regional expansion, resulting in co-occurring and phenotypically convergent species on high-elevation volcanic slopes. Like other endemic island lineages, Psiadia have been highly successful in dispersing to and radiating on isolated oceanic islands, typified by high habitat diversity and dynamic ecosystems fuelled by continued geological activity. Results stress the important biogeographical role for Rodrigues in serving as an outlying stepping stone from which regional colonization took place. We discuss how isolated volcanic islands contribute to regional diversity by generating substantial numbers of endemic species on short temporal scales. Factors pertaining to the mode and tempo of archipelago formation and its geographical isolation strongly govern evolutionary pathways available for species diversification, and the potential for successful diversification of dispersed lineages, therefore, appears highly dependent on the timing of arrival, as habitat and resource properties change dramatically over the course of oceanic island evolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Strijk","given":"Joeri S."},{"family":"Noyes","given":"Richard D."},{"family":"Strasberg","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Cruaud","given":"Corinne"},{"family":"Gavory","given":"Fredéric"},{"family":"Chase","given":"Mark W."},{"family":"Abbott","given":"Richard J."},{"family":"Thébaud","given":"Christophe"}],"citation-key":"strijk.etal2012","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0042932","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",8,10]]},"language":"en","page":"e42932","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"In and out of Madagascar: Dispersal to Peripheral Islands, Insular Speciation and Diversification of Indian Ocean Daisy Trees (Psiadia, Asteraceae)","title-short":"In and out of Madagascar","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0042932","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"susanti.etal2021","abstract":"Intensively managed monoculture plantations are increasingly replacing natural forests across the tropics resulting in changes in ecological niches of species and communities, and in ecosystem functioning. Collembola are among the most abundant arthropods inhabiting the belowground system sensitively responding to changes in vegetation and soil conditions. However, most studies on the response of Collembola to land-use change were conducted in temperate ecosystems and focused on shifts in community composition or morphological traits, while parameters more closely linked to ecosystem functioning, such as trophic niches, received little attention. Here, we used stable isotope analysis (13C and 15N) to investigate changes in the trophic structure and use of food resources by Collembola in Jambi province (Sumatra, Indonesia), a region that experienced strong deforestation in the last decades. Isotopic values of Collembola from 32 sites representing four land-use systems were analyzed (rainforest, rubber agroforest, rubber (Hevea brasiliansis) and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) monoculture plantations). Across Collembola species Δ13C values were highest in rainforest suggesting more pronounced processing of litter resources by microorganisms and consumption of these microorganisms by Collembola in this system. Lower Δ13C values, but high Δ13C variation in Collembola in oil palm plantations indicated that Collembola shifted towards herbivory and used more variable resources in this system. Small range in Δ15N values in Collembola species in monoculture plantations in comparison to rainforest indicated that conversion of rainforest into plantations is associated with simplification in the trophic structure of Collembola communities. This was further confirmed by generally lower isotopic niche differentiation among species in plantations. Across the studied ecosystems, atmobiotic species (Symphypleona and Paronellidae) occupied the lowest, whereas euedaphic Collembola species occupied the highest trophic position, resembling patterns in temperate forests. Some species of Paronellidae in rainforest and jungle rubber had Δ15N values below those of leaf litter suggesting algivory (Salina sp.1, Callyntrura sp.1 and Lepidonella sp.1), while a dominant species, Pseudosinella sp.1, had the highest Δ15N values in most of the land-use systems suggesting that this species at least in part lives as predator or scavenger. Overall, the results suggest that rainforest conversion into plantation systems is associated with marked shifts in the structure of trophic niches in soil and litter Collembola with potential consequences for ecosystem functioning and food-web stability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Susanti","given":"Winda Ika"},{"family":"Widyastuti","given":"Rahayu"},{"family":"Scheu","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Potapov","given":"Anton"}],"citation-key":"susanti.etal2021","container-title":"PeerJ","container-title-short":"PeerJ","DOI":"10.7717/peerj.10971","ISSN":"2167-8359","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,2]]},"language":"en","page":"e10971","publisher":"PeerJ Inc.","source":"peerj.com","title":"Trophic niche differentiation and utilisation of food resources in Collembola is altered by rainforest conversion to plantation systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://peerj.com/articles/10971","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"susanti.etal2024","abstract":"Rainforest conversion and expansion of plantations in tropical regions change local microclimate and are associated with biodiversity decline. Tropical soils are a hotspot of animal biodiversity and may sensitively respond to microclimate changes, but these responses remain unexplored. To address this knowledge gap, here we investigated seasonal fluctuations in density and community composition of Collembola, a dominant group of soil invertebrates, in rainforest, and in rubber and oil palm plantations in Jambi province (Sumatra, Indonesia). Across land-use systems, the density of Collembola in the litter was at a maximum at the beginning of the wet season, whereas in soil it generally varied little. The community composition of Collembola changed with season and the differences between land-use systems were most pronounced at the beginning of the dry season. Water content, pH, fungal and bacterial biomarkers, C/N ratio and root biomass were identified as factors related to seasonal variations in species composition of Collembola across different land-use systems. We conclude that (1) conversion of rainforest into plantation systems aggravates detrimental effects of low moisture during the dry season on soil invertebrate communities; (2) Collembola communities are driven by common environmental factors across land-use systems, with water content, pH and food availability being most important; (3) Collembola in litter are more sensitive to climatic variations than those in soil. Overall, the results document the sensitivity of tropical soil invertebrate communities to seasonal climatic variations, which intensifies the effects of the conversion of rainforest into plantation systems on soil biodiversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Susanti","given":"Winda Ika"},{"family":"Krashevska","given":"Valentyna"},{"family":"Widyastuti","given":"Rahayu"},{"family":"Stiegler","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Gunawan","given":"Dodo"},{"family":"Scheu","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Potapov","given":"Anton M."}],"citation-key":"susanti.etal2024","container-title":"PeerJ","container-title-short":"PeerJ","DOI":"10.7717/peerj.17125","ISSN":"2167-8359","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"e17125","publisher":"PeerJ Inc.","source":"peerj.com","title":"Seasonal fluctuations of litter and soil Collembola and their drivers in rainforest and plantation systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://peerj.com/articles/17125","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"swanepoel.etal2021","abstract":"Nematodes play an important role in agricultural soil in terms of their pest status and their contribution to soil quality, where they may serve as a valuable indicator of soil health. The aim of the study was to assess changes occurring in nematode community structure, as affected by soil tillage applied to high N-input and irrigated pastures in South Africa. Such practices were investigated by means of analysing diversity and ecosystem function indices, as well as the faunal profile, to enable analysis of their effect on soil quality. The pre-treatment soil analyses showed a low overall mean nematode density. No clear and predictable pattern was present in the nematode community structure in relation to tillage. The lack of indicative information leading from the nematode community structure to the tillage disturbance types might be linked to the fact that such systems were able to recover from soil disturbance within the relatively short period of less than a year.","author":[{"family":"Swanepoel","given":"Pieter A."},{"family":"Kapp","given":"Caro"},{"family":"Malan","given":"Antoinette P."},{"family":"Storey","given":"Sheila G."},{"family":"Ammann","given":"Sigrun B."}],"citation-key":"swanepoel.etal2021","container-title":"Journal of plant diseases and protection (2006)","event-place":"Berlin/Heidelberg","ISSN":"1861-3829","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"eng","page":"1667-1678","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher-place":"Berlin/Heidelberg","title":"Relating nematode community structure to different kikuyu-ryegrass pasture establishment methods","type":"article-journal","volume":"128"},

  {"id":"szumigalski.vanacker2006","abstract":"Nitrogen is the most limiting nutrient for crop production on the northern Great Plains of North America. This study was initiated to determine if N yield and land use efficiency for N could be improved by manipulating crop diversity using three annual crops (wheat, Triticum aestivum L.; canola, Brassica napus L.; and field pea, Pisum arvense L.) commonly grown on the Canadian Prairies. The study included all combinations of the crops (sole crops and intercrops) and compared their effects on soil N depletion, plant N concentration, plant N yield, and land equivalent ratios for dry matter and grain N yield (NLER) at two field sites in Manitoba, Canada. The pea sole crop treatment tended to result in higher fall soil nitrate (NO3−)–N concentrations compared to other treatments, indicating greater potential for post-season NO3− leaching after this treatment. There were often greater N concentrations in wheat, canola, and weeds when grown in association with field pea, suggesting that soil N could have been made available for nonlegume uptake through the NO3−–N sparing effect On average, most intercrop treatments resulted in more efficient land use for N compared to component sole crops, with overall mean intercrop NLER values ranging from 1.10 to 1.20. The wheat–canola–pea and canola–pea intercrop treatments tended to produce the highest and most consistent NLER values for crop dry matter and grain yield, respectively. The results of this study suggest that intercrops could be used for more efficient use of N on a per land area basis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Szumigalski","given":"Anthony R."},{"family":"Van Acker","given":"Rene C."}],"citation-key":"szumigalski.vanacker2006","container-title":"Agronomy Journal","DOI":"10.2134/agronj2005.0277","ISSN":"1435-0645","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"language":"en","page":"1030-1040","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Nitrogen Yield and Land Use Efficiency in Annual Sole Crops and Intercrops","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/agronj2005.0277","volume":"98"},

  {"id":"tajovsky.etal","abstract":"The development of soil fauna assemblages (testate amoebae, nematodes, enchytraeids, earthworms, terrestrial isopods, millipedes, centipedes, collembolans, dipteran larvae) has been investigated in a field experiment since autumn 1999. Four types of treatment were studied in plots previously managed as arable land: 1) sowing with a native seed mixture, 2) sowing of a 5 m wide central strip with native and the lateral strips with commercial seed mixture, 3) sowing of a 5 m wide central strip with native seed mixture, leaving the lateral strips to spontaneous succession, and 4) leaving to spontaneous succession (abandoned field). The observed increase of qualitative and quantitative parameters of the individual soil animal groups corresponded to the initial phase of successional development. Eurytopic and euryvalent representatives as well as epigeic species of soil micro-, meso- and macrofauna prevailed in the studied treatments during the first years of observation. Animals characteristic for grassland biotopes appeared after the intense development of the vegetation cover. The species pool existing in the surrounding habitats affected significantly the development of some groups of soil macrofauna (terrestrial isopods, millipedes) as shown by their increasing epigeic activity. The type of treatment influenced the development of soil fauna indirectly through the variability of microsite conditions and available food resources.","author":[{"family":"Tajovský","given":"Karel"},{"family":"Pižl","given":"Václav"},{"family":"Starý","given":"Josef"},{"family":"Balík","given":"Vladimír"},{"family":"Frouz","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Schlaghamerský","given":"Í"},{"family":"Hán","given":"Ladislav"},{"family":"Rusek","given":"Josef"},{"family":"Kal","given":"Í"}],"citation-key":"tajovsky.etal","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Development of soil fauna in meadows restored on arable land: Initial phases of successional development","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"tang.etal2019","abstract":"Most people consider cockroaches to be quintessential urban pests, even though very few of the 5000 cockroach species live in urban areas. The German cockroach is the most widespread and common cockroach in urban areas, however how this invasive species has spread globally is poorly understood. We reviewed the published and grey literatures, and museum data, to document the spread of the German cockroach, and how it may have interacted with other urban cockroach species. We found that the German cockroach likely originated from South Asia, was introduced into Europe no later than the 18th century, from where it invaded worldwide. The spread of the German cockroach was facilitated by the improvement of transportation technologies, especially from colonial trading, and indoor heating in cooler climates. Studies of population genetics have found that once introduced into a new location, the German cockroach spread rapidly through local expansion, and this could be within single (large, multiple-story) buildings. This local expansion resulted in displacement of other urban cockroach species, likely due to their small size requiring fewer resources, shorter generation times and so faster evolution, especially for pesticide resistance. These findings may help to identify new pest management methods. Future research could use genetic tools at larger scales to map distribution routes across the globe and interaction with pesticides and the evolution of resistance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Tang","given":"Qian"},{"family":"Bourguignon","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Willenmse","given":"Luc"},{"family":"De Coninck","given":"Eliane"},{"family":"Evans","given":"Theodore"}],"citation-key":"tang.etal2019","container-title":"Biological Invasions","container-title-short":"Biol Invasions","DOI":"10.1007/s10530-018-1865-2","ISSN":"1573-1464","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"693-707","source":"Springer Link","title":"Global spread of the German cockroach, Blattella germanica","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10530-018-1865-2","volume":"21"},
  {"id":"theangiospermphylogenygroup.etal2016","abstract":"An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) classification of the orders and families of angiosperms is presented. Several new orders are recognized: Boraginales, Dilleniales, Icacinales, Metteniusiales and Vahliales. This brings the total number of orders and families recognized in the APG system to 64 and 416, respectively. We propose two additional informal major clades, superrosids and superasterids, that each comprise the additional orders that are included in the larger clades dominated by the rosids and asterids. Families that made up potentially monofamilial orders, Dasypogonaceae and Sabiaceae, are instead referred to Arecales and Proteales, respectively. Two parasitic families formerly of uncertain positions are now placed: Cynomoriaceae in Saxifragales and Apodanthaceae in Cucurbitales. Although there is evidence that some families recognized in APG III are not monophyletic, we make no changes in Dioscoreales and Santalales relative to APG III and leave some genera in Lamiales unplaced (e.g. Peltanthera). These changes in familial circumscription and recognition have all resulted from new results published since APG III, except for some changes simply due to nomenclatural issues, which include substituting Asphodelaceae for Xanthorrhoeaceae (Asparagales) and Francoaceae for Melianthaceae (Geraniales); however, in Francoaceae we also include Bersamaceae, Ledocarpaceae, Rhynchothecaceae and Vivianiaceae. Other changes to family limits are not drastic or numerous and are mostly focused on some members of the lamiids, especially the former Icacinaceae that have long been problematic with several genera moved to the formerly monogeneric Metteniusaceae, but minor changes in circumscription include Aristolochiaceae (now including Lactoridaceae and Hydnoraceae; Aristolochiales), Maundiaceae (removed from Juncaginaceae; Alismatales), Restionaceae (now re-including Anarthriaceae and Centrolepidaceae; Poales), Buxaceae (now including Haptanthaceae; Buxales), Peraceae (split from Euphorbiaceae; Malpighiales), recognition of Petenaeaceae (Huerteales), Kewaceae, Limeaceae, Macarthuriaceae and Microteaceae (all Caryophyllales), Petiveriaceae split from Phytolaccaceae (Caryophyllales), changes to the generic composition of Ixonanthaceae and Irvingiaceae (with transfer of Allantospermum from the former to the latter; Malpighiales), transfer of Pakaraimaea (formerly Dipterocarpaceae) to Cistaceae (Malvales), transfer of Borthwickia, Forchhammeria, Stixis and Tirania (formerly all Capparaceae) to Resedaceae (Brassicales), Nyssaceae split from Cornaceae (Cornales), Pteleocarpa moved to Gelsemiaceae (Gentianales), changes to the generic composition of Gesneriaceae (Sanango moved from Loganiaceae) and Orobanchaceae (now including Lindenbergiaceae and Rehmanniaceae) and recognition of Mazaceae distinct from Phrymaceae (all Lamiales).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,13]]},"author":[{"literal":"The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group"},{"family":"Chase","given":"M.

  {"id":"thoresen.etal2021","abstract":"Soil arthropods are important components of savannas, contributing to nutrient cycling and thus primary productivity. To investigate how fire and mammalian herbivores influence arthropod food webs, we used two long term herbivore exclosures (ca. 20 y) and burning trials (ca. 5-y return) located along rivers in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Herbivory and fire will usually have negative effects on soil arthropods although this can be variable, and dependent on multiple aspects of habitat structure and nutrient cycling. We hypothesised that in our sites, the more chronic herbivory disturbance would have stronger and more effects than fire, and that both fire and herbivory would decrease arthropod abundance, biomass and diversity via changes to habitat structure and nutrient cycling. We used a structural equation model to investigate these mechanisms, and to compare these drivers. This model supported our hypothesis that herbivory had more and stronger effects than fire, largely through indirect flow-on effects. We also found evidence to support a ‘tolerance/avoidance’ hypothesis, in that herbivory increased soil arthropod diversity by decreasing soil nutrients. Herbivores also decreased arthropod biomass and abundance in total and in all trophic groups excluding omnivores. Fire and herbivory are closely linked, careful consideration should be made when making decisions in the management of either. In some areas either driver may be more dominant, as was the case in our research. Further studies should incorporate a range of fire frequencies and intensities, as well as herbivore types, densities and abundances. •Generally, disturbance reduced soil arthropod abundance and biomass but increased diversity.•Disturbances affected arthropods via changes to habitat structure and nutrient cycling.•Specific effects were diverse involving multiple interactions and trade-offs .•Fire and herbivore management should consider site specifics and trade-offs.","author":[{"family":"Thoresen","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Vermeire","given":"Marie-Liesse"},{"family":"Venter","given":"Zander"},{"family":"Wolfaard","given":"Graeme"},{"family":"Krumins","given":"Jennifer Adams"},{"family":"Cramer","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Hawkins","given":"Heidi-Jayne"}],"citation-key":"thoresen.etal2021","container-title":"Global ecology and conservation","ISSN":"2351-9894","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"eng","page":"e01413-","publisher":"Elsevier B.V","title":"Fire and herbivory shape soil arthropod communities through habitat heterogeneity and nutrient cycling in savannas","type":"article-journal","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"tibbett.etal2020","abstract":"A decline in soil biodiversity is generally considered to be the reduction of forms of life living in soils, both in terms of quantity and variety. Where soil biodiversity decline occurs, it can significantly affect the soils' ability to function, respond to perturbations and recover from a disturbance. Several soil threats have been identified as having negative effects on soil biodiversity, including human intensive exploitation, land-use change and soil organic matter decline. In this review we consider what we mean by soil biodiversity, and why it is important to monitor. After a thorough review of the literature identified on a Web of Science search concerning threats to soil biodiversity (topic search: threat* \"soil biodiversity\"), we compiled a table of biodiversity threats considered in each paper including climate change, land use change, intensive human exploitation, decline in soil health or plastic; followed by detailed listings of threats studied. This we compared to a previously published expert assessment of threats to soil biodiversity. In addition, we identified emerging threats, particularly microplastics, in the 10 years following these knowledge based rankings. We found that many soil biodiversity studies do not focus on biodiversity sensu stricto, rather these studies examined either changes in abundance and/or diversity of individual groups of soil biota, instead of soil biodiversity as a whole, encompassing all levels of the soil food web. This highlights the complexity of soil biodiversity which is often impractical to assess in all but the largest studies. Published global scientific activity was only partially related to the threats identified by the expert panel assessment. The number of threats and the priority given to the threats (by number of publications) were quite different, indicating a disparity between research actions versus perceived threats. The lack of research effort in key areas of high priority in the threats to soil biodiversity are a concerning finding and requires some consideration and debate in the research community.","author":[{"family":"Tibbett","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Fraser","given":"Tandra D."},{"family":"Duddigan","given":"Sarah"}],"citation-key":"tibbett.etal2020","container-title":"PeerJ","container-title-short":"PeerJ","DOI":"10.7717/peerj.9271","ISSN":"2167-8359","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"eng","page":"e9271","PMCID":"PMC7295018","PMID":"32566399","source":"PubMed","title":"Identifying potential threats to soil biodiversity","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},

However, the many possible approaches and techniques for model selection, and the conflicting recommendations for their use, can be confusing. We contend that much confusion surrounding statistical model selection results from failing to first clearly specify the purpose of the analysis. We argue that there are three distinct goals for statistical modeling in ecology: data exploration, inference, and prediction. Once the modeling goal is clearly articulated, an appropriate model selection procedure is easier to identify. We review model selection approaches and highlight their strengths and weaknesses relative to each of the three modeling goals. We then present examples of modeling for exploration, inference, and prediction using a time series of butterfly population counts. These show how a model selection approach flows naturally from the modeling goal, leading to different models selected for different purposes, even with exactly the same data set. This review illustrates best practices for ecologists and should serve as a reminder that statistical recipes cannot substitute for critical thinking or for the use of independent data to test hypotheses and validate predictions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Tredennick","given":"Andrew T."},{"family":"Hooker","given":"Giles"},{"family":"Ellner","given":"Stephen P."},{"family":"Adler","given":"Peter B."}],"citation-key":"tredennick.etal2021","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1002/ecy.3336","ISSN":"1939-9170","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"e03336","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A practical guide to selecting models for exploration, inference, and prediction in ecology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.3336","volume":"102"},
  {"id":"tscharntke.etal2012","abstract":"Under the current scenario of rapid human population increase, achieving efﬁcient and productive agricultural land use while conserving biodiversity is a global challenge. There is an ongoing debate whether land for nature and for production should be segregated (land sparing) or integrated on the same land (land sharing, wildlife-friendly farming). While recent studies argue for agricultural intensiﬁcation in a land sparing approach, we suggest here that it fails to account for real-world complexity. We argue that agriculture practiced under smallholder farmer-dominated landscapes and not large-scale farming, is currently the backbone of global food security in the developing world. Furthermore, contemporary food usage is inefﬁcient with one third wasted and a further third used inefﬁciently to feed livestock and that conventional intensiﬁcation causes often overlooked environmental costs. A major argument for wildlife friendly farming and agroecological intensiﬁcation is that crucial ecosystem services are provided by ‘‘planned’’ and ‘‘associated’’ biodiversity, whereas the land sparing concept implies that biodiversity in agroecosystems is functionally negligible. However, loss of biological control can result in dramatic increases of pest densities, pollinator services affect a third of global human food supply, and inappropriate agricultural management can lead to environmental degradation. Hence, the true value of functional biodiversity on the farm is often inadequately acknowledged or understood, while conventional intensiﬁcation tends to disrupt beneﬁcial functions of biodiversity. In conclusion, linking agricultural intensiﬁcation with biodiversity conservation and hunger reduction requires well-informed regional and targeted solutions, something which the land sparing vs sharing debate has failed to achieve so far.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Tscharntke","given":"Teja"},{"family":"Clough","given":"Yann"},{"family":"Wanger","given":"Thomas C."},{"family":"Jackson","given":"Louise"},{"family":"Motzke","given":"Iris"},{"family":"Perfecto","given":"Ivette"},{"family":"Vandermeer","given":"John"},{"family":"Whitbread","given":"Anthony"}],"citation-key":"tscharntke.etal2012","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2012.01.068","ISSN":"00063207","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",7]]},"language":"en","page":"53-59","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Global food security, biodiversity conservation and the future of agricultural intensification","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320712000821","volume":"151"},
  {"id":"tsiafouli.etal2015","abstract":"Soil biodiversity plays a key role in regulating the processes that underpin the delivery of ecosystem goods and services in terrestrial ecosystems. Agricultural intensiﬁcation is known to change the diversity of individual groups of soil biota, but less is known about how intensiﬁcation affects biodiversity of the soil food web as a whole, and whether or not these effects may be generalized across regions. We examined biodiversity in soil food webs from grasslands, extensive, and intensive rotations in four agricultural regions across Europe: in Sweden, the UK, the Czech Republic and Greece. Effects of land-use intensity were quantiﬁed based on structure and diversity among functional groups in the soil food web, as well as on community-weighted mean body mass of soil fauna. We also elucidate land-use intensity effects on diversity of taxonomic units within taxonomic groups of soil fauna. We found that between regions soil food web diversity measures were variable, but that increasing land-use intensity caused highly consistent responses. In particular, land-use intensiﬁcation reduced the complexity in the soil food webs, as well as the community-weighted mean body mass of soil fauna. In all regions across Europe, species richness of earthworms, Collembolans, and oribatid mites was negatively affected by increased land-use intensity. The taxonomic distinctness, which is a measure of taxonomic relatedness of species in a community that is independent of species richness, was also reduced by land-use intensiﬁcation. We conclude that intensive agriculture reduces soil biodiversity, making soil food webs less diverse and composed of smaller bodied organisms. Land-use intensiﬁcation results in fewer functional groups of soil biota with fewer and taxonomically more closely related species. We discuss how these changes in soil biodiversity due to land-use intensiﬁcation may threaten the functioning of soil in agricultural production systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Tsiafouli","given":"Maria A."},{"family":"Thébault","given":"Elisa"},{"family":"Sgardelis","given":"Stefanos P."},{"family":"De Ruiter","given":"Peter C."},{"family":"Van Der Putten","given":"Wim H."},{"family":"Birkhofer","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Hemerik","given":"Lia"},{"family":"De Vries","given":"Franciska T."},{"family":"Bardgett","given":"Richard D."},{"family":"Brady","given":"Mark Vincent"},{"family":"Bjornlund","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Jørgensen","given":"Helene Bracht"},{"family":"Christensen","given":"Sören"},{"family":"Hertefeldt","given":"Tina D’"},{"family":"Hotes","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Gera Hol","given":"W.H."},{"family":"Frouz","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Liiri","given":"Mira"},{"family":"Mortimer","given":"Simon R."},{"family":"Setälä","given":"Heikki"},{"family":"Tzanopoulos","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Uteseny","given":"Karoline"},{"family":"Pižl","given":"Václav"},{"family":"Stary","given":"Josef"},{"family":"Wolters","given":"Volkmar"},{"family":"Hedlund","given":"Katarina"}],"citation-key":"tsiafouli.etal2015","container-title":"Global Change Biology","container-title-short":"Global Change Biology","DOI":"10.1111/gcb.12752","ISSN":"1354-1013, 1365-2486","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",2]]},"language":"en","page":"973-985","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Intensive agriculture reduces soil biodiversity across Europe","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.12752","volume":"21"},

To examine niche differences, we must first characterize how species occupy niche space, and two approaches are commonly used in the ecological literature. The first uses species traits to estimate multivariate trait space (so-called functional trait diversity, FD); the second quantifies the amount of time or evolutionary history captured by a group of species (phylogenetic diversity, PD). It is often—but controversially—assumed that these putative measures of niche space are at a minimum correlated and perhaps redundant, since more evolutionary time allows for greater accumulation of trait changes. This theoretical expectation remains surprisingly poorly evaluated, particularly in the context of multivariate measures of trait diversity. We evaluated the relationship between phylogenetic diversity and trait diversity using analytical and simulation-based methods across common models of trait evolution. We show that PD correlates with FD increasingly strongly as more traits are included in the FD measure. Our results indicate that phylogenetic diversity can be a useful surrogate for high-dimensional trait diversity, but we also show that the correlation weakens when the underlying process of trait evolution includes variation in rate and optima.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Tucker","given":"Caroline M."},{"family":"Davies","given":"T.

  {"id":"tuma.etal2020","abstract":"Animal interactions play an important role in understanding ecological processes. The nature and intensity of these interactions can shape the impacts of organisms on their environment. Because ants and termites, with their high biomass and range of ecological functions, have considerable effects on their environment, the interaction between them is important for ecosystem processes. Although the manner in which ants and termites interact is becoming increasingly well studied, there has been no synthesis to date of the available literature. Here we review and synthesise all existing literature on ant–termite interactions. We infer that ant predation on termites is the most important, most widespread, and most studied type of interaction. Predatory ant species can regulate termite populations and subsequently slow down the decomposition of wood, litter and soil organic matter. As a consequence they also affect plant growth and distribution, nutrient cycling and nutrient availability. Although some ant species are specialised termite predators, there is probably a high level of opportunistic predation by generalist ant species, and hence their impact on ecosystem processes that termites are known to provide varies at the species level. The most fruitful future research direction will be to evaluate the impact of ant–termite predation on broader ecosystem processes. To do this it will be necessary to quantify the efficacy both of particular ant species and of ant communities as a whole in regulating termite populations in different biomes. We envisage that this work will require a combination of methods, including DNA barcoding of ant gut contents along with field observations and exclusion experiments. Such a combined approach is necessary for assessing how this interaction influences entire ecosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Tuma","given":"Jiri"},{"family":"Eggleton","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Fayle","given":"Tom M."}],"citation-key":"tuma.etal2020","container-title":"Biological Reviews","DOI":"10.1111/brv.12577","ISSN":"1469-185X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","page":"555-572","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Ant-termite interactions: an important but under-explored ecological linkage","title-short":"Ant-termite interactions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/brv.12577","volume":"95"},

  {"id":"vallejo-marin.hiscock2016","abstract":"Summary\n            An unintended consequence of global change is an increase in opportunities for hybridization among previously isolated lineages. Here we illustrate how global change can facilitate the breakdown of reproductive barriers and the formation of hybrids, drawing on the flora of the British Isles for insight. Although global change may ameliorate some of the barriers preventing hybrid establishment, for example by providing new ecological niches for hybrids, it will have limited effects on environment‐independent post‐zygotic barriers. For example, genic incompatibilities and differences in chromosome numbers and structure within hybrid genomes are unlikely to be affected by global change. We thus speculate that global change will have a larger effect on eroding pre‐zygotic barriers (eco‐geographical isolation and phenology) than post‐zygotic barriers, shifting the relative importance of these two classes of reproductive barriers from what is usually seen in naturally produced hybrids where pre‐zygotic barriers are the largest contributors to reproductive isolation. Although the long‐term fate of neo‐hybrids is still to be determined, the massive impact of global change on the dynamics and distribution of biodiversity generates an unprecedented opportunity to study large numbers of unpredicted, and often replicated, hybridization ‘experiments’, allowing us to peer into the birth and death of evolutionary lineages.\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                      Contents\n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                      Summary\n                      1170\n                    \n                    \n                      I.\n                      \n                        Introduction\n                      \n                      1170\n                    \n                    \n                      II.\n                      \n                        Hybrid formation\n                      \n                      1172\n                    \n                    \n                      III.\n                      \n                        Hybrid establishment: overcoming intrinsic and extrinsic post‐zygotic barriers\n                      \n                      1175\n                    \n                    \n                      IV.\n                      \n                        Outcomes of hybridization\n                      \n                      1180\n                    \n                    \n                      V.\n                      \n                        Outlook\n                      \n                      1183\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                      \n                        Acknowledgements\n                      \n                      1184\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                      \n                        References\n                      \n                      1184","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Vallejo‐Marín","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Hiscock","given":"Simon J."}],"citation-key":"vallejo-marin.hiscock2016","container-title":"New Phytologist","container-title-short":"New Phytologist","DOI":"10.1111/nph.14004","ISSN":"0028-646X, 1469-8137","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",9]]},"language":"en","page":"1170-1187","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Hybridization and hybrid speciation under global change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.14004","volume":"211"},

  {"id":"vancise.etal2017","abstract":"Social structure can have a significant impact on divergence and evolution within species, especially in the marine environment, which has few environmental boundaries to dispersal. On the other hand, genetic structure can affect social structure in many species, through an individual preference towards associating with relatives. One social species, the short-finned pilot whale (Globicephala macrorhynchus), has been shown to live in stable social groups for periods of at least a decade. Using mitochondrial control sequences from 242 individuals and single nucleotide polymorphisms from 106 individuals, we examine population structure among geographic and social groups of short-finned pilot whales in the Hawaiian Islands, and test for links between social and genetic structure. Our results show that there are at least two geographic populations in the Hawaiian Islands: a Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) population and a Northwestern Hawaiian Islands/Pelagic population (FST and ΦST p < .001), as well as an eastern MHI community and a western MHI community (FST p = .009). We find genetically driven social structure, or high relatedness among social units and clusters (p < .001), and a positive relationship between relatedness and association between individuals (p < .0001). Further, socially organized clusters are genetically distinct, indicating that social structure drives genetic divergence within the population, likely through restricted mate selection (FST p = .05). This genetic divergence among social groups can make the species less resilient to anthropogenic or ecological disturbance. Conservation of this species therefore depends on understanding links among social structure, genetic structure and ecological variability within the species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Van Cise","given":"Amy M."},{"family":"Martien","given":"Karen.

  {"id":"vanhall.etal2023","abstract":"A better understanding of how soil organic matter (OM) content influences pesticide toxicity to soil invertebrates is needed to improve the ecological relevance of risk assessment approaches. In the current study, soil invertebrate toxicity data (LC50 and EC50 values) were collected from studies determining the toxicity of organic chemicals in soils with varying OM content. Relevant studies were identified by performing a literature search and through the use of toxicity databases. The data were used to address the following questions: (1) Can the relationship between toxicity and soil OM content be quantified? (2) Does soil OM content influence different toxicity endpoints in a similar way? (3) Is the influence of soil OM content on sensitivity to pesticides different between species? The results indicate that toxicity—OM relationships are chemical dependent, differ between endpoints, and are species-specific. Hence, the grouping of chemicals based solely on their lipophilicity, as well as having only one correction factor for multiple species, may not be an appropriate approach to risk assessment.

In this paper, we aim to determine the colonization of soil biota in new substrates, using collembola assemblages as an indicator. In Northern France, we sampled collembola communities in 11 coal mine spoil tips and their surroundings divided in four stages of vegetation development: bare soil, meadow, shrub and tree covers. We demonstrated that collembola assemblages of spoil tips were different from those observed in the surrounding native soil. Collembola communities on bare soil were characterized by pioneer (based on the\n              Indval\n              index) or exotic species (new in Northern France). However, homogenization occurred with development of vegetation cover. Indeed, our data showed no difference in springtail diversity between spoil tips and their corresponding environments regarding the tree vegetation cover. Using the\n              Indval\n              method, we defined pioneer, colonizing, opportunist or stenoecious species as a function of substrate affinities. Using the same method, we defined specialists, elective, preferring or indifferent species as a function of vegetation cover affinities, showing similarities with previously published surveys. Hence, our results were obtained by a focused analysis of species and their particularity. Finally, we discussed the interest in and the complementarity between the species analysis approach and the methodology dealing with functional traits and of its importance in the decision process of restoration and/or conservation of nature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Vanhée","given":"Benoit"},{"family":"Devigne","given":"Cédric"}],"citation-key":"vanhee.devigne2018","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-018-36315-1","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,24]]},"language":"en","page":"18067","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Differences in collembola species assemblages (Arthropoda) between spoil tips and surrounding environments are dependent on vegetation development","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-36315-1","volume":"8"},

Despite its long history, the validity of this phylogenetic limiting similarity hypothesis has rarely been examined. Here we provided a formal experimental test of the hypothesis using pairs of bacterivorous protist species in a multigenerational experiment. Consistent with the hypothesis, both the frequency and tempo of competitive exclusion, and the reduction in the abundance of inferior competitors, increased with increasing phylogenetic relatedness of the competing species. These results were linked to protist mouth size, a trait potentially related to resource use, exhibiting a signiﬁcant phylogenetic signal. The likelihood of coexistence, however, was better predicted by phylogenetic relatedness than trait similarity of the competing species.

The exact nature of the habitat in which the community of organisms is living is determined by a complex interplay of geology, climate, and plant vegetation. This interaction of rock and parent material with temperature, rainfall, elevation, latitude, exposure to sun and wind, and many more factors over broad geographical regions with similar environmental conditions and characteristic plant communities has evolved into the current terrestrial biomes with their associated soils. Soil habitat is characterized by heterogeneities across all measured scales, from nanometers to kilometers, which differ in chemical, physical, and biological characteristics in both space and time. At various levels within this continuum of scales, different soil properties used to characterize the soil habitat can assume greater or lesser importance depending on the function or attribute that is under consideration. The concepts of soil genesis and the formation of soil habitat are explained in the chapter.

However, despite sitting at the foundation of human and ecosystem sustainability, soils are often ignored in scientific discussions of global issues. This book synthesizes current knowledge on soil ecosystem services, and provides a basis for the maintenance of soil health and sustainability. It begins by examining the living soil as a habitat in terms of biodiversity, functions, and ecosystem services. Soil ecosystem services are explored and explained at different scales from genes of microbes to whole ecosystems. The book discusses the importance of biodiversity to ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services with regards to phylogeny, biogeography, and diversity of important soil fauna groups, from microbes to large ecosystem engineers. The influence of global environmental changes such as climate change, nutrient enrichment, urbanization, and land use change, and their effect on soils and ecosystem services, are discussed. Finally, the book outlines how sustainability of soils, biodiversity, and ecosystem services can be monitored, maintained, and restored, and how humans, other animals, and ecosystems are dependent on living soils and ecosystem services.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Wall","given":"Diana H."}],"citation-key":"wall2012","DOI":"10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199575923.001.0001","editor":[{"family":"Bardgett","given":"Richard D."},{"family":"Behan-Pelletier","given":"Valerie"},{"family":"Herrick","given":"Jeffrey E."},{"family":"Jones","given":"T.

  {"id":"wang.etal2024","abstract":"Litter decomposition is key to ecosystem carbon (C) and nutrient cycling, but this process is anticipated to weaken due to projected more extensive and prolonged drought. Yet how litter quality and decomposer community complexity regulate decomposition in response to drought is less understood. Here, in a five-year manipulative drought experiment in a Masson pine forest, leaf litter from four subtropical tree species (Quercus griffithii Hook.f. & Thomson ex Miq., Acacia mangium Willd., Pinus massoniana Lamb., Castanopsis hystrix Miq.) representing different qualities were decomposed for 350 d in litterbags of three mesh sizes (i.e., 0.05, 1, and 5 mm), respectively, under natural conditions and 50% throughfall rain exclusion treatment. Litterbags of increasing mesh sizes discriminate decomposers communities (i.e. microorganisms, microorganisms and mesofauna, microorganisms and meso- and macrofauna) that access the litter and represent an increasing complexity. The amount of litter C and nitrogen (N) loss, and changes in their ratio (C/Nloss), as well as small and medium-sized decomposers including microorganisms, nematodes, and arthropods, were investigated. We found that drought did not affect C and N loss but decreased C/Nloss (i.e., decomposer N use efficiency) of leaf litter irrespective of litter quality and decomposer complexity. However, changes in the C/Nloss and the drought effect on C loss were both dependent on litter quality, while drought and decomposer complexity interactively affected litter C and N loss. Increasing decomposer community complexity enhanced litter decomposition and allowing additional access of meso- and macro-fauna to litterbags mitigated the negative drought effect on the microbial-driven decomposition. Furthermore, both the increased diversity and altered trophic structure of nematode due to drought contributed to the mitigation effects via cascading interactions. Our results show that litter quality and soil decomposer community complexity co-drive the effect of drought on litter decomposition. This experimental finding provides a new insight into the mechanisms controlling forest floor C and nutrient cycling under future global change scenarios.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Shumei"},{"family":"Luan","given":"Junwei"},{"family":"Li","given":"Siyu"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Jinhao"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Lin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Shirong"}],"citation-key":"wang.etal2024","container-title":"Forest Ecosystems","container-title-short":"Forest Ecosystems","DOI":"10.1016/j.fecs.2024.100194","ISSN":"2197-5620","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,8]]},"page":"100194","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Litter quality and decomposer complexity co-drive effect of drought on decomposition","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2197562024000307"},

Despite Madagascar’s extreme isolation from India and proximity to Africa, a high proportion of the biota of the Madagascar region has Asian affinities. This pattern has rarely been viewed as surprising, as it is consistent with Gondwanan vicariance. Molecular phylogenetic data provide strong support for such Asian affinities, but often not for their vicariant origin; most divergences between lineages in Asia and the Madagascar region post-date the separation of India and Madagascar considerably (up to 87 Myr), implying a high frequency of dispersal that mirrors colonization of the Hawaiian archipelago in distance. Indian Ocean bathymetry and the magnitude of recent sea-level lowstands support the repeated existence of sizeable islands across the western Indian Ocean, greatly reducing the isolation of Madagascar from Asia.

I describe two indices that use the number of nodes that separate taxa on a phylogeny as a measure of their phylogenetic relatedness. As an example of the use of these indices in community analysis, I compared the mean observed net relatedness of trees (≥10 cm diameter at breast height) in each of 28 plots (each 0.16 ha) in a Bornean rain forest with the net relatedness expected if species were drawn randomly from the species pool (of the 324 species in the 28 plots), using a supertree that I assembled from published sources. I found that the species in plots were more phylogenetically related than expected by chance, a result that was insensitive to various modiﬁcations to the basic methodology. I tentatively infer that variation in habitat among plots causes ecologically more similar species to co-occur within plots. Finally, I suggest a range of applications for phylogenetic relatedness measures in community analysis.","author":[{"family":"Webb","given":"Campbell O"}],"citation-key":"webb2000","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Exploring the Phylogenetic Structure of Ecological Communities: An Example for Rain Forest Trees","type":"article-journal"},

Island systems are key natural laboratories for testing theory in ecology and evolution. However, despite their potential usefulness for research, a quantitative description of island environments and an environmental classification are still lacking. Here, we prepare a standardized dataset and perform a comprehensive global environmental characterization for 17,883 of the world’s marine islands >1 km2 (∼98% of total island area). We consider area, temperature, precipitation, seasonality in temperature and precipitation, past climate change velocity, elevation, isolation, and past connectivity—key island characteristics and drivers of ecosystem processes. We find that islands are significantly cooler, wetter, and less seasonal than mainlands. Constrained by their limited area, they show less elevational heterogeneity. Wet temperate climates are more prevalent on islands, whereas desert climates are comparatively rare. We use ordination and clustering to characterize islands in multidimensional environmental space and to delimit island ecoregions, which provides unique insights into the environmental configuration and diversity of the world’s islands. Combining ordination and classification together with global environmental data in a common framework opens up avenues for a more integrative use of islands in biogeography, macroecology, and conservation. To showcase possible applications of the presented data, we predict vascular plant species richness for all 17,883 islands based on statistically derived environment–richness relationships.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Weigelt","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Jetz","given":"Walter"},{"family":"Kreft","given":"Holger"}],"citation-key":"weigelt.etal2013","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1306309110","issue":"38","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",9,17]]},"page":"15307-15312","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"pnas.org (Atypon)","title":"Bioclimatic and physical characterization of the world’s islands","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1306309110","volume":"110"},

  {"id":"whitehead2017","abstract":"Whales and dolphins (Cetacea) have excellent social learning skills as well as a long and strong mother–calf bond. These features produce stable cultures, and, in some species, sympatric groups with different cultures. There is evidence and speculation that this cultural transmission of behavior has affected gene distributions. Culture seems to have driven killer whales into distinct ecotypes, which may be incipient species or subspecies. There are ecotype-specific signals of selection in functional genes that correspond to cultural foraging behavior and habitat use by the different ecotypes. The five species of whale with matrilineal social systems have remarkably low diversity of mtDNA. Cultural hitchhiking, the transmission of functionally neutral genes in parallel with selective cultural traits, is a plausible hypothesis for this low diversity, especially in sperm whales. In killer whales the ecotype divisions, together with founding bottlenecks, selection, and cultural hitchhiking, likely explain the low mtDNA diversity. Several cetacean species show habitat-specific distributions of mtDNA haplotypes, probably the result of mother–offspring cultural transmission of migration routes or destinations. In bottlenose dolphins, remarkable small-scale differences in haplotype distribution result from maternal cultural transmission of foraging methods, and large-scale redistributions of sperm whale cultural clans in the Pacific have likely changed mitochondrial genetic geography. With the acceleration of genomics new results should come fast, but understanding gene–culture coevolution will be hampered by the measured pace of research on the socio-cultural side of cetacean biology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Whitehead","given":"Hal"}],"citation-key":"whitehead2017","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

Recently, there has been progress in resolving these debates, favoring a lineage-based, evolutionary species concept. This progress calls for reconsideration of the study of speciation. Traditional speciation research based on the biological species concept has led to great advances in understanding how nonallopatric speciation occurs and how species diverge and remain separate from each other. However, this research has neglected the question of how new species arise in the ﬁrst place for the most common geographic mode (allopatric).

The extent to which flowering-time response to temperature is shared among closely related species might have important consequences for community-wide patterns of species loss under rapid climate change. Henry David Thoreau initiated a dataset of the Concord, Massachusetts, flora that spans ≈150 years and provides information on changes in species abundance and flowering time. When these data are analyzed in a phylogenetic context, they indicate that change in abundance is strongly correlated with flowering-time response.

Recent observations of submarine geology, heat, and rock magnetism have tended to support some form of continental drift rather than the older concept of a rigid earth.The Hawaiian Islands are one of seven, parallel, linear chains of islands and seamounts in the Pacific Ocean of Tertiary to Recent age. Their nature had previously been explained in terms of a series of volcanoes along parallel faults. Horizontal shear motion along these faults was supposed to be extending them southeasterly.The inadequacies of this explanation are pointed out. If there are convection currents in the Pacific region and if the upper parts of these cells move faster than the central parts, sources of lava within the slower moving cores could give rise to linear chains of progressively older volcanic piles such as the Hawaiian Islands.

  {"id":"wipfler.etal2019","abstract":"Polyneoptera represents one of the major lineages of winged insects, comprising around 40,000 extant species in 10 traditional orders, including grasshoppers, roaches, and stoneflies. Many important aspects of polyneopteran evolution, such as their phylogenetic relationships, changes in their external appearance, their habitat preferences, and social behavior, are unresolved and are a major enigma in entomology. These ambiguities also have direct consequences for our understanding of the evolution of winged insects in general; for example, with respect to the ancestral habitats of adults and juveniles. We addressed these issues with a large-scale phylogenomic analysis and used the reconstructed phylogenetic relationships to trace the evolution of 112 characters associated with the external appearance and the lifestyle of winged insects. Our inferences suggest that the last common ancestors of Polyneoptera and of the winged insects were terrestrial throughout their lives, implying that wings did not evolve in an aquatic environment. The appearance of the first polyneopteran insect was mainly characterized by ancestral traits such as long segmented abdominal appendages and biting mouthparts held below the head capsule. This ancestor lived in association with the ground, which led to various specializations including hardened forewings and unique tarsal attachment structures. However, within Polyneoptera, several groups switched separately to a life on plants. In contrast to a previous hypothesis, we found that social behavior was not part of the polyneopteran ground plan. In other traits, such as the biting mouthparts, Polyneoptera shows a high degree of evolutionary conservatism unique among the major lineages of winged insects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Wipfler","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Letsch","given":"Harald"},{"family":"Frandsen","given":"Paul B."},{"family":"Kapli","given":"Paschalia"},{"family":"Mayer","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Bartel","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Buckley","given":"Thomas R."},{"family":"Donath","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Edgerly-Rooks","given":"Janice S."},{"family":"Fujita","given":"Mari"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Shanlin"},{"family":"Machida","given":"Ryuichiro"},{"family":"Mashimo","given":"Yuta"},{"family":"Misof","given":"Bernhard"},{"family":"Niehuis","given":"Oliver"},{"family":"Peters","given":"Ralph S."},{"family":"Petersen","given":"Malte"},{"family":"Podsiadlowski","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Schütte","given":"Kai"},{"family":"Shimizu","given":"Shota"},{"family":"Uchifune","given":"Toshiki"},{"family":"Wilbrandt","given":"Jeanne"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Evgeny"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Xin"},{"family":"Simon","given":"Sabrina"}],"citation-key":"wipfler.etal2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"wolters2001","abstract":"Current knowledge suggests a high redundancy of soil organism communities, i.e. saturation of function at low levels of species richness. This does not imply, however, that research on soil organism biodiversity and its function is irrelevant. First, it is well established that several species of the decomposer community are functionally more important than others. The ‘step’ hypothesis developed in this paper shows that under these conditions random loss of species is much more likely to impact ecosystem processes than expected from the redundancy hypothesis. Second, redundant species may gain functional significance by interacting with functionally important species. Third, the number of ‘important species’ is increased by the multiplicity of functions carried out by soil biota. And finally, alteration in species composition will not be a random process. In fact, functionally important soil biota might be among the first to be affected by large-scale changes in land use. Even if we were to accept that conservation efforts should be confined to the functionally most important species, we would have no idea how to do so. Crossing the ‘spatial barrier’ seems to be the biggest challenge for future investigations on soil biodiversity, because traditional approaches of community ecology will not be sufficient to answer the questions originating from large-scale impoverishment of the soil fauna. Some examples of promising macroecological topics are discussed: (i) the impact of the regional species pool on local species richness, (ii) the relationship between α- and γ-diversity, and (iii) abundance-occupancy relationships. It is argued that research in this direction will be essential for answering the question of how populations and communities must be organised to resist alterations of the soil habitat at the landscape-level.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Wolters","given":"Volkmar"}],"citation-key":"wolters2001","container-title":"European Journal of Soil Biology","container-title-short":"European Journal of Soil Biology","DOI":"10.1016/S1164-5563(01)01088-3","ISSN":"1164-5563","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"221-227","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Biodiversity of soil animals and its function","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1164556301010883","volume":"37"},

In general, model organisms and crop pests (generally Insecta) are well-studied, while important soil-dwelling predators, fungivores and detritivores (e.g., Collembola, Chilopoda and Malacostraca) remain largely ignored.

Using the soil faunal community as an indicator of soil quality is not cost-effective because of the complex taxonomic distinction and identification required, moreover; the power of the assessment is weak in relation to soil function. Recently, a functional method incorporating eco-morphological traits has been proposed, but it depends upon presence/absence data of soil arthropod community exclusively. To overcome the limitation, we designed a novel index using the diversity of the soil faunal community along with its functional traits, and the abundance of its members (Abundance-based Fauna Index, referred as FAI). The FAI method supports both the presence/absence data and its abundance. Using real and simulated data sets with eco-morphological and niche breadth traits, two taxonomic independent functional traits, we tested associations of FAI values with soil quality and found a good relationship.

Despite extensive efforts in reconstructing the phylogeny of Gentianales based on molecular data, some interfamily and intrafamily relationships remain uncertain. We reconstructed the genus-level phylogeny of Gentianales based on the supermatrix of eight plastid markers (rbcL, matK, atpB, ndhF, rpl16, rps16, the trnL-trnF region, and atpB-rbcL spacer) and one mitochondrial gene (matR) using maximum likelihood. The major clades and their relationships retrieved in the present study concur with those of previous studies. All of the ﬁve families of Gentianales are monophyletic with strong support. We resolved Rubiaceae as sister to the remaining families in Gentianales and showed support for the sister relationship between Loganiaceae and Apocynaceae.

We also assess how arthropod assemblages respond to the environmental changes at the boundaries between natural forest patches and the two different surrounding vegetation types.\n                \n                \n                  Twenty transects were selected, ten natural forests surrounded by pines, and ten natural forests surrounded by natural grassland. Transects ran from natural forest interiors, across the boundary into the interior of the surrounding vegetation. Arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps and active searches.\n                \n                \n                  Natural forests surrounded by grassland had higher species richness than those surrounded by pines. Greater arthropod abundance was in grassland edges than other stations. Pairwise comparisons revealed significant differences in assemblages between all vegetation types. This implies that forest biodiversity in these patches is altered by the main vegetation type in the matrix or in close proximity. Qualitative differences in assemblages between natural forest‐grassland boundaries were greater than differences between natural forest‐pine boundaries, indicating greater sharing of species between pines and natural forests.\n                \n                \n                  Our findings emphasise the value of natural forest‐grassland edges for conserving arthropod diversity as they add to the local species pool. Overall, we show that when maintaining small isolated natural forest patches, the role of the surrounding vegetation must be considered as it has a major influence on the local patch fauna.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Yekwayo","given":"Inam"},{"family":"Pryke","given":"James S."},{"family":"Roets","given":"Francois"},{"family":"Samways","given":"Michael J."}],"citation-key":"yekwayo.etal2016","container-title":"Insect Conservation and Diversity","container-title-short":"Insect Conserv Diversity","DOI":"10.1111/icad.12160","editor":[{"family":"Stewart","given":"Alan"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Jörg"}],"ISSN":"1752-458X, 1752-4598","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",5]]},"language":"en","page":"224-235","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Surrounding vegetation matters for arthropods of small, natural patches of indigenous forest","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://resjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/icad.12160","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"yin.etal2019","abstract":"Collembola are highly abundant and diverse soil animals and play key roles in litter decomposition and nutrient cycling. Given their functional significance, it is important to understand their responses to human-induced global changes, such as climate change and land-use intensification. Here, we utilized an experimental field study, to test the interactive effects of climate (ambient vs. future) and land use (five land-use regimes, from extensively-used meadow to conventional farming) on three eco-morphological life forms of Collembola: epedaphic, hemiedaphic, and euedaphic species. We found that the effects of climate change on Collembola density were modulated by land use, and that the responses of different life forms to climate × land use interaction differed in magnitude and/or direction. The densities of total and hemiedaphic Collembola significantly decreased under organic farming and marginally increased in grasslands under future climatic conditions, whereas epedaphic Collembola tended to decrease their density with climate change in grasslands. In contrast, the density of euedaphic Collembola significantly increased with climate change in intensively-used grasslands. Further, we found that grasslands (especially extensively-used meadow) support the most abundant Collembola communities, with high species richness but low evenness. Multivariate analyses revealed independent effects of climate change and land-use intensification on Collembola community composition. Together, our findings indicate that the effects of climate change on Collembola communities depend on their life forms and land-use types. Surface-dwelling Collembola are more vulnerable to land use and climate change than those living in deeper soil layers. This may slow down the process of soil-surface litter decomposition in a changing world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Yin","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Gruss","given":"Iwona"},{"family":"Eisenhauer","given":"Nico"},{"family":"Kardol","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Thakur","given":"Madhav P."},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Anja"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Zhengfeng"},{"family":"Siebert","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Chensheng"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Gao-Lin"},{"family":"Schädler","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"yin.etal2019","container-title":"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","container-title-short":"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","DOI":"10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.107598","ISSN":"00380717","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11]]},"language":"en","page":"107598","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Land use modulates the effects of climate change on density but not community composition of Collembola","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0038071719302627","volume":"138"},

  {"id":"yu.etal2016","abstract":"Tomoceridae is common but among the most problematic groups of Collembola. Its position within Collembola and the relationships within the family remain obscure. This also extends to the generic division of the subfamily Tomocerinae that remains controversial. This study examines these issues by integrating both molecular and morphological evidence. Our molecular phylogeny based on rDNA sequences supports the monophyly of Tomoceridae and the sister relationship between Tomocerinae and Lepidophorellinae. Reconstructions and tree topology tests constraining monophyly did not resolve the relationships between Tomoceridae and other collembolan groups. We also examined the morphology of the first instar (primary) larvae, which has significant phylogenetic value among higher Collembola. Mapping primary chaetotaxy onto our molecular phylogeny provided further evidence for the unique position of Tomoceridae within Entomobryomorpha and Collembola. The monophyly and subfamilial classification within Tomoceridae were validated here, whereas its position among Collembola will need further studies in a broader consideration across the major collembolan orders. Within Tomocerinae, the monophyly of Pogonognathellus was demonstrated, but the status of Tomocerus and Tomocerina is still to be resolved.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Yu","given":"Daoyuan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Stevens","given":"Mark I."},{"family":"Yan","given":"Qibao"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Manqiang"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Feng"}],"citation-key":"yu.etal2016","container-title":"Zoologica Scripta","DOI":"10.1111/zsc.12149","ISSN":"03003256","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",5]]},"page":"286-299","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","source":"EBSCOhost","title":"New insight into the systematics of Tomoceridae (Hexapoda, Collembola) by integrating molecular and morphological evidence","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://ezproxy.uct.ac.za/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aph&AN=114640006&site=ehost-live","volume":"45"},
  {"id":"zhang.deharveng2015","abstract":"Tibiotarsi, particularly their chaetotaxy, vary from species to orders in Collembola. Symphypleona, Poduromorpha and Isotomidae have been shown to possess characteristic patterns of tibiotarsal chaetotaxy, but the patterns in Entomobryoidea and Tomoceroidea, where a strong plurichaetosis is the rule, remains undocumented. The tibiotarsal chaetotaxy of first instars of 11 species of the main Entomobryidae subfamilies is described here for the first time. A basic pattern of five whorls with eight chaetae per whorl was found to occur in all examined species of Entomobryidae, with limited variations in the distal and proximal whorls. This pattern is similar to that of Symphypleona. Two hypotheses appear possible according to existing phylogenies, making it difficult to determine whether this obvious homology in tibiotarsal chaetotaxy is a plesiomorphy, which appeared independently in both superfamilies, or is a synapomorphy. We conclude that the primary chaetotaxy of tibiotarsus appears to be of high taxonomical value at suprafamilial but not at generic or tribal level.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Deharveng","given":"Louis"}],"citation-key":"zhang.deharveng2015","container-title":"Zootaxa","container-title-short":"Zootaxa","DOI":"10.11646/zootaxa.3955.4.2","ISSN":"1175-5334","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",5,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"487-504","PMID":"25947867","source":"Europe PMC","title":"First instar tibiotarsal chaetotaxy supports the Entomobryidae and Symphypleona (Collembola) forming a cluster in a phylogenetic tree","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.3955.4.2","volume":"3955"},

  {"id":"zhang.etal2015","abstract":"The jumping organ (furcula) is the most characteristic structure among collembolans and it is of great taxonomical values at higher levels. The largest superfamily Entomobryoidea is traditionally classified into four families only by the morphology of the furcula. Actually, many taxa among these families are strikingly similar in morphology without considering furcula. The phylogeny of Entomobryoidea was reconstructed here based on mitochondrial and ribosomal fragments. This indicated that both Paronellidae and Cyphoderidae were ingroups within Entomobryidae with the former polyphyletic. Topology tests, which used the likelihood and Bayesian approaches, also rejected the traditional hypotheses relying on furcula morphology. Further ancestral state reconstructions have revealed that traditional taxonomical characters, i.e., furcula and body scales, had multiple independent origins in Entomobryoidea whereas tergal specialized chaetae (S-chaetae) exhibited strong phylogenetic signals. By integrating both molecular and morphological evidence, the results of this study drastically undermine the present classification of Entomobryoidea. Tergal S-chaetotaxic pattern in combination with other characters are more reasonable in taxonomy at suprageneric levels than convergent furcula. This study provides new insights of the jumping organ, which could be adaptively modified during evolution of Collembola.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Dan-Dan"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Dao-Yuan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Bei-Xin"}],"citation-key":"zhang.etal2015","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/srep12471","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",7,27]]},"language":"en","license":"2015 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"12471","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Molecular phylogeny supports S-chaetae as a key character better than jumping organs and body scales in classification of Entomobryoidea (Collembola)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep12471","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"zhang.etal2019","abstract":"The largest superfamily Entomobryoidea is one of the key groups in Collembola. However, incorrect recognition of chaetotaxic homology within Entomobryoidea severely impedes the accurate species comparison of adults and phylogenetic reconstruction. Traditional classification of the superfamily at suprageneric level is disputable in the light of recent advances. Transformational homology of tergal chaetotaxy was traced and revised based on 38 species of first instar and partial early instars. Morphological phylogenetic reconstructions were reconstructed mainly relying on first instar characters using both parsimony and likelihoodbased algorithms. Outgroup selection and several rogue taxa impacted on resolution and support of otherwise well-supported clades. Integrating published molecular phylogeny, a revised classification of three families and nine subfamilies was presented: Orchesellidae, Entomobryidae and Paronellidae. Orchesellidae includes all basal taxa having a short fourth abdominal segment. Cyphoderidae and Microfalculidae taxa were sunk into Paronellidae. New Paronellidae was divided into two subfamilies: Paronellinae (Paronellini + Cyphoderini + Bromacanthini) and Salininae (Cremastocephalini + Callyntrurini). Microfalculidae (Microfalcula) was closer to Salina and Akabosia and thus transferred into Cremastocephalini. This study erected a new classification framework for Entomobryoidea based upon comprehensive phylogenies. Chaetotaxic homologization across a wide range provided a standardized, comparable, powerful tool for taxonomy.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Bellini","given":"Bruno C"},{"family":"Soto-Adames","given":"Felipe N"}],"citation-key":"zhang.etal2019","container-title":"Zoological Systematics","DOI":"DOI: 10.11865/zs.201926","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"249-278","source":"Zotero","title":"New insights into the systematics of Entomobryoidea (Collembola: Entomobryomorpha): first instar chaetotaxy, homology and classification","type":"article-journal","volume":"44"},
